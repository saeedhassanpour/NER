Background: Clinical decision rules have been validated for the evaluation of ED patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Evidence-based clinical decision support (CDS) has been shown to decrease the use of unnecessary imaging, but it is unclear whether CDS has affected adherence to evidence-based decision guidelines.  
Objectives: To determine physician adherence to an evidence-based guideline when employing CDS on the use of computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for ED patients with suspected PE. We hypothesized that CDS would result in >80% adherence to the evidence-based guideline.
Methods: From April 2012 to September 2012, evidence-based CDS based on the Wells criteria and D-dimer testing was deployed at three urban EDs with a shared electronic medical record (EMR) and computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system.  Decision support was provided at the time of the CTPA order for patients with suspected PE. The primary outcome was the rate of adherence to the evidence-based guideline; secondary outcome was the percentage of CTPA orders cancelled after CDS deployment. Descriptive statistics with 95% CI’s were calculated. 
Results: Over the study period, CDS was deployed for 818 patients with suspected PE (mean age 53+/- 18 years, 68% female, 59% black, 33% with chest pain as the chief complaint, 66% admitted). Of the 818 patients, 496 (61%, 95% CI: 57-64%) of the CTPA orders adhered to the guideline, 235 (29%, 95% CI: 26-32%) did not adhere to the guideline, and 87 (11%, 95% CI: 9-12%) were not covered by the guideline. Twenty (8.5%, 95% CI: 5.3-12.8%) of the CTPA orders which did not adhere to the guideline were cancelled at the time of decision support.
Conclusion: Despite CDS implementation, 29% of CTPA orders for ED patients with suspected PE did not adhere to an evidence-based guideline. Of the CTPA orders which did not adhere to the guideline, 8.5% were cancelled in response to CDS at the time of order entry.
