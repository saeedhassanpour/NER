ES> <REPOCT of the chest without contrast media as per coronary calcification protocol. 

CT scan of the heart was done to evaluate for coronary artery calcification. The examination is positive and shows definite calcium deposits which are diagnostic of atherosclerotic disease. The calcium score is 5. This score places this patient in the 42 percentile for quantity of calcification for her age and gender group when compared to our age and gender matched control group. There is calcification at the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Remainder is negative.

Renal stone quantification evaluation pending validation. Initial estimate includes: Right kidney (A/V) 36/36; left, 90/82. No urinary calculi. Cholecystectomy. Slight aortic calcification.

79.330  </EXAM_CODES> <REPONonenhanced chest CT with reconstructed thin section images is compared to CT of 2/19/07. The prominent precarinal lymph node is slightly smaller today, but remains larger than on 9/12/06. The loculated pleural fluid in the left lower chest posteriorly has decreased slightly in size. There is a new pleural or subpleural nodule in the left lower chest posterolaterally (series 2, image 42) measuring approximately 2.1cm, worrisome for tumor. Pleural thickening elsewhere in the left base has decreased slightly. There is mild bilateral gynecomastia, slightly more on the right, which has increased slightly. Remainder unchanged. PO left lower lobectomy. Advanced emphysematous changes and scattered scarring bilaterally. Negative adrenal glands. Cardiac pacer. Vascular calcifications, including coronary artery calcifications. Left renal cyst.

Nonenhanced chest CT shows extensive fibrosis with associated honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis in the periphery and bases of both lungs. The findings have progressed moderately since 9/27/05. Marked enlargement of the central pulmonary arteries due to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Calcified right hilar and mediastinal nodes with calcified granulomas in the liver and spleen. Extensive coronary artery calcification. Tiny calculi in the right kidney. Generous adrenal glands without discrete mass.

Small irregular nodules in the right lung are unchanged from previous study of   9-27-04,   and, therefore, should be benign. No new pulmonary nodules. No lymphadenopathy. Mild changes of emphysema in the right lung. Slight fibrosis right base. Vascular including coronary artery calcifications.

ES> <REPONonenhanced chest CT shows bilateral pleural plaques some of which are calcified suggesting prior asbestos exposure. Small right pleural effusion. Mass-like   area of consolidation in the base of the right lower lobe medially most likely represents roundedatelectasis. Recommend follow-up   chest CT in six months to a year to ensure stability. No other pulmonary nodules or lymphadenopathy. Focal area of fibrosis in the base of the right middle lobe with associated mild traction bronchiectasis. Vascular including coronary artery calcifications. Multiple bilateral low density lesions in the kidneys most likely represent cysts. Ultrasound would be useful for further evaluation.  Bilateral gynecomastia.

Contrast enhanced CT of the chest with comparison to recent PE study of 4/30/07. Exam is read in conjunction with the Indium-111   labeled white blood cell study of 5/4/07. Degenerative arthritis with vacuum phenonomen in the mid thoracic spine. Thoracic kyphosis. Compression fractures of T4-T7   vertebral bodies. Also mild compression L1.  No evidence of posterior mediastinal mass or abscess. MRI would be more sensitive in further evaluation for discitis/osteomyelitis. Slight interval increase in the bilateral pleural effusions since the PE study of 4/30/07.Associated compressive atelectasis/infiltrates. New, hazy infiltrate in the right upper lung anteriorly. Otherwise no significant change from previous. Small pericardial effusion or thickening. Aortic calcification. Cholelithiasis. Cortical scarring both kidneys. Watchman device in the left atrial appendage with thrombus. Fatty  atrophy of the pancreas.

A small nodule in the left base posteriorly (series 2, image 42) has enlargedslightly. Numerous other very small bilateral pulmonary nodules have not changed appreciably. No definite new nodules. Radiation fibrosis with volume loss in the right midlung anteriorly. Stable scattered scarring in the bases. Scattered skeletal metastases, a few of which are slightly more prominent. Healing pathologic fractures of the posterolateral left 8th and 9th ribs, with slightly more callus formation today. Mild heterogeneous enlargement of the both lobes of the thyroid gland, unchanged.
