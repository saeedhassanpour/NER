37817795 FULL RESULT:  
Examination:  CT Chest, 09/08/2008. 

Clinical History:  Fibrous histiocytoma. Evaluate for metastases. 

Findings:  As noted, there are posttreatment changes in both lungs and pleural and parenchymal features with the most noted in the left lateral posterior chest wall. This area does have some pleural and reactive changes. Many sites have been present for some time; however, there is one focal area that is a little bit more prominent than the other. This is indeterminate at this time and suggest continued evaluation on routine fashion or if any clinical findings at this site, followup intervention with MRI may be helpful. However, these findings on the CT are indeterminate. No evidence of new parenchymal pulmonary nodules, and the intrathoracic opacities are similar to prior studies of 01/07/2008.  


IMPRESSION: 
1. Bilateral pleural and parenchymal posttreatment changes with the most noted feature being the posterior lateral aspect of the left chest wall with rib resection and soft tissue prominence as well as pleural reactive change. On image 54 series 2, this is more prominent chest wall soft tissues in the subpleural space compared to 01/07/2008; however, this has varied and was prominent on the prior study of 05/14/2007 as well, and suggest clinical correlation to see if there are any signs of symptoms of disease at this site. If so, MRI of the chest wall might be more helpful in demonstrating any reactive or new changes. However, at this time, these features are fairly consistent with posttreatment changes. No evidence of gross or new disease. 
2. There is changes in the left shoulder and left chest wall and upper arm consistent with underlying osteopenia most likely related to the prior intervention treatment with some dysfunction. CT         CT, LUNG, MEDIASTINUM PLEURA

37501395 FULL RESULT:  
Examination:  Chest CT with contrast, 06/05/2008 

Clinical History:  Breast cancer, follow up pulmonary nodules. 

Comparison:  12/17/2007. 

Findings:  Spiral CT of the chest was performed with 2.5-mm collimation using intravenous contrast. The cardiac chamber sizes are normal. Coronary artery calcifications are present. Tiny pericardial effusion. Adenopathy at the right hilum and ill-defined right and left paratracheal lymph nodes are unchanged. There are a number of scattered small pulmonary nodules in the 1-3-mm range of size in both lungs. There is a little lesser degree of inspiration with increased attenuation of lung bases with some minimal dependent atelectasis. No effusion. Low attenuation hepatic lesions are presumably simple cysts. Cholecystectomy clips and nephrectomy clips on the right. The remainder of the visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.  


IMPRESSION: 
Adenopathy and tiny pulmonary nodules remain unchanged and nonspecific over almost a year now. Active metastatic disease is unlikely. They may be followed up to document long term stability. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST
