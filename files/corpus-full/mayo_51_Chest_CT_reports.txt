These include lymph nodes in the left preauricular-parotid gland, left posterior auricular, left sub-occipital subcutaneous tissues, right preauricular and left submandibular regions. There are other scattered small cutaneous nodules and lymph nodes similar in appearance. Brain negative.

OCT of the chest and abdomen with and with contrast enhancement, done according to the protocol for aortic dissection: 

No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolus. There is extensive atherosclerotic calcification in the arterial system with dense calcification of the coronary arteries. In the abdominal aorta, at the level of the superior mesenteric artery, there is a large atheromatous plaque posteriorly with an irregular surface on its luminal side. Sternotomy with CABG. Degenerative changes throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine. Small right renal cysts.

 CTA Chest/Abdomen, aorta runoff w or wo 3D.:

THORACIC AORTA:

Diffuse atheromatous changes throughout the arch and descending thoracic aorta. Origin of the left subclavian is occluded for a short distance. Origin of left common carotid has a patent stent within it. The majority of the stent extends down into the aortic lumen. Mild stenosis in the mid innominate artery. Mild to moderate stenosis proximal right subclavian artery. Mild stenosis origin right common carotid. These arch vessels are best visualized in series 400. Proximal anastomosis of the right to femoral bypass graft is widely patent. 

ABDOMINAL AORTA: 

Advanced atheromatous changes involving the infrarenal abdominal aorta which then occludes at the bifurcation. Mild stenoses at the origin of the renal arteries. 

RIGHT LEG: 

Common iliac is occluded. External iliac fills via the internal iliac which is fed via collaterals. The femoral anastomosis with the axillary graft is widely patent. Mild stenosis at the origin of the SFA. Minimal disease below the common femoral. There is three vessel run-off which is relatively poorly seen due to very fast flow in this exam covering a very long distance. 

LEFT LEG: 

The femoral anastomosis of the bifurcated axillary graft is widely patent. Moderate to high grade stenosis at the origin of the SFA. Mild stenosis at the origin of the profunda. More distal SFA and popliteal are widely patent. Three vessel run-off however the tibials are very poorly visualized due to the rapid flow in this patient.

 CTA of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with 3D reconstructions is compared to the CT urogram dated 4-10-07. 

THORACIC AORTA:  Diffuse atheromatous changes throughout the thoracic aorta beginning in the proximal arch. There are moderate to high-grade stenoses at the origin of the common carotid. There is a small short focal dissection at the origin of the innominate which causes a moderate grade stenosis. PO CABG with two patent vein grafts and patent LIMA. 

ABDOMINAL AORTA:  Diffuse atheromatous changes. Shaggy atheromatous debris in the suprarenal abdominal aorta. Aneurysmal dilatation begins at the level of the renal arteries and extends to the aortic bifurcation with a maximum dimension measuring approximately 6cm. By my measurements, this is unchanged when compared to our recent CT urogram. 

PELVIS:  Moderate to high-grade stenoses at the origins of the common iliacs. High-grade stenosis origin left internal iliac. Moderate grade stenosis origin right internal iliac. External iliacs are diffusely diseased with moderate to high-grade stenosis on the right. Common femorals show advanced disease bilaterally and are significantly narrowed by large plaques. Proximal right SFA is occluded for a very shoft distance. Right profunda stenosis. Left profunda stenosis. 

EXTRAVASCULAR FINDINGS:  Advanced emphysematous changes throughout both lungs.

CHEST: Diffuse atherosclerotic changes in a normal sized thoracic aorta. No significant change compared to 11-14-06. Coronary artery calcifications. Emphysematous changes throughout both lungs. Stable tiny indeterminate nodule right middle lobe. Subtle hazy focal infiltrate in the lateral and posterior right middle lobe. Tiny nodule superior segment of the right lower lobe (series 4, image 106), unchanged. Stable enhancing nodule in the anterior mediastinum.

ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm is unchanged in size compared to 11-14-06, and now measures 6x5.1cm compared to 5.9x5cm previously. The neck of the aneurysm has irregular mural thrombus posteriorly. The lowest renal artery is on the right. The neck length appears short, although on the 3D reconstructions it is about 15mm in length with diameter of 23x26mm. The distance from the lowest renal artery to the aortic bifurcation is 15cm and the distance from the aortic bifurcation to the iliac bifurcation is 4cm on the right and 5cm on the left. The celiac, the SMA and single renal arteries are all patent. The common iliac arteries are normal in size with a moderate amount of calcified plaque. Mild stenosis at the distal right common iliac artery. The internal iliac arteries are patent bilaterally with diffuse atherosclerotic changes. The external iliac arteries are patent without stenosis and normal in size. Little atherosclerotic plaque in the common femoral arteries with no stenosis. Renal and hepatic cysts. Tarlov cyst in the sacrum.

 CTA of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with 3D reconstructions is compared to prior study of 7-7-06. 

THORACIC AORTA: No change in the mildly aneurysmal ascending aorta with maximum dimension remaining at 3.8cm. Ascending aorta gradually returns to normal caliber through the arch. Great vessels remain widely patent. No evidence for active vasculitis. 

ABDOMINAL AORTA: Since the prior study, the paravisceral aneurysm has been repaired. There are four new grafts arising from the aorta. The most cephalad is anastomosed primarily with the left gastric artery which is a major blood supply to the spleen. The spleen appears better enhanced today. The next graft is occluded just beyond its origin. It presumably would have gone to the SMA. The third graft arises medially off the aortic graft and is anastomosed to the right renal artery. There is some irregularity at the anastomosis with mild to moderate grade stenosis. The right kidney, however, is better perfused when compared to the prior study and there has been no further atrophy. The fourth graft is to the left of the renal artery and is widely patent. There is a significant change in caliber at the anastomosis but no stenosis is seen. The celiac is occluded. The proximal SMA is occluded. The IMA is a very large vessel and provides extensive collateral networks to the SMA and hepatic distributions. The right hepatic artery is replaced to the proximal SMA. Probable fibroid involvement of the uterus.

Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest performed according to the pulmonary embolus protocol(IV infiltrated during examination): 
Exam quality is limited due to patient body habitus and mild respiratory motion. No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary emboli. There is a questionable filling defect in the distal left lower pulmonary artery (series 7 image 73) this likely represents partial volumning related to mild respiratory motion.  Cardiac size at the upper limits of normal. Scoliosis. Mild bilateral dependent atelectasis. Results discussed with Dr. Schiebel pager 46344.

OClinical history: Shortness of breath and chest pain. 

PROCEDURE: CT of the chest performed with contrast per standard PE protocol. 

FINDINGS: The examination is limited due to suboptimal contrast bolus. The right upper lobe pulmonary artery is suboptimally seen however the appearance is not typical for embolus. No obvious filling defects are noted. Scattered calcified hilar lymph nodes are seen. The lungs are clear. Fatty infiltration of the liver. 

CONCLUSION: Limited contrast-enhanced CT of the chest with no definite pulmonary embolus. Findings phoned to Dr. Goyal in the ED.
