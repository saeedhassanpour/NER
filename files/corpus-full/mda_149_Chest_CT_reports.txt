37817795 FULL RESULT:  
Examination:  CT Chest, 09/08/2008. 

Clinical History:  Fibrous histiocytoma. Evaluate for metastases. 

Findings:  As noted, there are posttreatment changes in both lungs and pleural and parenchymal features with the most noted in the left lateral posterior chest wall. This area does have some pleural and reactive changes. Many sites have been present for some time; however, there is one focal area that is a little bit more prominent than the other. This is indeterminate at this time and suggest continued evaluation on routine fashion or if any clinical findings at this site, followup intervention with MRI may be helpful. However, these findings on the CT are indeterminate. No evidence of new parenchymal pulmonary nodules, and the intrathoracic opacities are similar to prior studies of 01/07/2008.  


IMPRESSION: 
1. Bilateral pleural and parenchymal posttreatment changes with the most noted feature being the posterior lateral aspect of the left chest wall with rib resection and soft tissue prominence as well as pleural reactive change. On image 54 series 2, this is more prominent chest wall soft tissues in the subpleural space compared to 01/07/2008; however, this has varied and was prominent on the prior study of 05/14/2007 as well, and suggest clinical correlation to see if there are any signs of symptoms of disease at this site. If so, MRI of the chest wall might be more helpful in demonstrating any reactive or new changes. However, at this time, these features are fairly consistent with posttreatment changes. No evidence of gross or new disease. 
2. There is changes in the left shoulder and left chest wall and upper arm consistent with underlying osteopenia most likely related to the prior intervention treatment with some dysfunction. CT         CT, LUNG, MEDIASTINUM PLEURA

Examination:  Chest CT with contrast, 06/05/2008 

Clinical History:  Breast cancer, follow up pulmonary nodules. 

Comparison:  12/17/2007. 

Findings:  Spiral CT of the chest was performed with 2.5-mm collimation using intravenous contrast. The cardiac chamber sizes are normal. Coronary artery calcifications are present. Tiny pericardial effusion. Adenopathy at the right hilum and ill-defined right and left paratracheal lymph nodes are unchanged. There are a number of scattered small pulmonary nodules in the 1-3-mm range of size in both lungs. There is a little lesser degree of inspiration with increased attenuation of lung bases with some minimal dependent atelectasis. No effusion. Low attenuation hepatic lesions are presumably simple cysts. Cholecystectomy clips and nephrectomy clips on the right. The remainder of the visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.  


IMPRESSION: 
Adenopathy and tiny pulmonary nodules remain unchanged and nonspecific over almost a year now. Active metastatic disease is unlikely. They may be followed up to document long term stability. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST

Clinical History:  Sarcoidosis, followup.  

Findings:  CT chest 7/12/2007 and 02/19/2008.  

Numerous subcentimeter nodules, in parenchymal or subpleural locations, and spiculated masses, like a band of fibrosis, are noted in the lungs bilaterally.  The pre-existing disease has been relatively stable.  Additionally, there is a localized area of new ground-glass opacities in the right base (image #71 to 77).  This is associated with peribronchial thickening and nodules.  This could represent superimposed infectious process.  However, the progressing sarcoidosis is probably more likely.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  

Additionally, there are multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum predominantly at the prevascular chain, right paratracheal chain and subcarinal chains as well as in the hila bilaterally, grossly unchanged.  There is no evidence of new lymph node or lymphadenopathy.  

The visualized soft tissue is unremarkable.

Examination:  CT scan of the chest, 08/07/2009.  

Clinical History:  Breast carcinoma.  

Findings:  

1.  Non intravenous contrast-enhanced scans have been obtained and there is a left pleural effusion with foci of loculation with some associated focal areas of pleural thickening in the region of the upper lobe of the left lung, a left chest tube is noted in place, findings can be clinically correlated for any malignant pleural effusion, this fluid was not noted on an outside hospital study obtained on 04/15/2005.

2.  There is no evidence of any confluent acute lung infiltrates.  Some linear subsegmental atelectatic foci are noted in the left lung.  There is no evidence of any lung nodules.  Some focal areas of pleural thickening in the right chest are identified and this may be related to chronic inflammatory changes.

3.  Some sclerotic foci are identified in some of the vertebral bodies and the ribs and in the sternum, findings compatible with metastatic foci (this cannot be compared to the outside hospital study of 04/15/2005 secondary to technical differences).  Additionally, there is compression with sclerosis superimposed on degenerative spondylosis in the seventh dorsal vertebral body and this may be related to metastasis superimposed on degenerative changes.

4.  There is a soft tissue attenuation focus in the midline of the lower chest in the anterior chest wall region abutting the sternal region with slight associated sternal sclerosis (series 2, images 32, 30), this measures approximately 2.4 x 1.6 cm in dimension and is compatible with recurrent focus.  This was not noted on the study of 2005, a focal opacity in the left lower anterior chest wall region (series 2, image 39) which may be related to postsurgical change is stable since the study of 2005.  Postsurgical changes are noted in the axillary and breast regions and some small axillary nodes possibly reactive in nature are identified.  There may be a tiny amount of air in the mediastinum (series 2, image 29).  


IMPRESSION:  
Left pleural effusion with loculation and this can be clinically correlated for malignant effusion, no lung nodules, soft tissue in the anterior chest wall region close to the midline as described, compatible with recurrence.

38898421 FULL RESULT:  
Examination: CT Scan of the Chest, 07/07/2009

Clinical History: Breast carcinoma, assess metastases. 

Findings: CT scan of the chest performed with iodine. The patients last chest CT is dated 01/12/2009. Review indicates the patient has had chemotherapy for the large left breast carcinoma which has certainly responded to such therapy. The decrease in size of the mass in the left breast is many orders of magnitude. Small lymph nodes in the left axillary area are unchanged and quite nonspecific as are a few in the right axillary area. 

Previously, there were some lymph nodes on the right side of the mediastinum, the most prominent being noted on image 15. It is difficult to fully assess this area on followup, but if anything they are less prominent, but this may be accounted for by volume averaging or cut level considerations. A few smaller lymph nodes scattered in the right peritracheal area are quite nonspecific. It is quite possible that the lymph nodes are reactive in nature. The small pulmonary nodule behind the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged and may just be a granuloma. There is no evidence of hilar lymphadenopathy. The upper abdomen included on this study shows a gallstone. A few very small scattered lymph nodes in the upper abdomen are quite nonspecific and likely reactive. They are unchanged from 01/12/2009. Noted in the upper abdomen is a small splenule which is also unchanged and shows normal anatomy. 

There is some degenerative change about aspects of the thoracic spine, but there is no evidence of any metastatic bone disease. 

Although difficult to compare, the original tumor did extend to the skin outline of the breast. The dominant area is considerably smaller, and there is some thickening of the skin anteriorly presumed to be post-therapeutic. 

Overall, there has been definite response to therapy with very significant decrease in the size of the left breast mass. As noted, there is no convincing evidence elsewhere that this patient has metastatic disease. Chemotherapy catheter noted to be in position.  


IMPRESSION:  
1. The last chest CT is dated 01/12/2009. The large mass in the left breast has undergone therapy and is considerably small on followup today such as seen on image 66 and 67 of series 2 in comparison as an example with image 54 on series 3 on 01/12/2009.

Clinical History:  Metastatic acinic cell carcinoma, for restaging.  

Findings:  CT of the chest was performed with intravenous contrast and compared with prior CT of 12/16/2009.

There is a nodule in the region of the left thyroid, series 5, image 9, which appears to have a corresponding FDG uptake on PET/CT of the same date.

Infiltrative tumor with pathologic fracture of the right shoulder, including the distal right clavicle, scapula and proximal humerus, has increased in size.  There is infiltrative disease into the adjacent musculature and subcutaneous tissues.

Oral contrast is seen within the esophagus from reflux along with a moderate hiatal hernia.

There are numerous bilateral pulmonary metastases.  There has been increase in some of these lesions as compared to CT of 12/16/09; for example, in the right upper lobe, series 6, image 19, a lesion measures 0.7 cm and previously measured 0.4 cm.  A nodule in the left lower lobe, image 69, measures 0.9 cm and previously measured 0.7 cm. Some of the pulmonary metastatic nodules, however, were larger on CT of 6/22/09. For example a nodule in the right upper lobe currently measures 0.6 cm on ser 6 image 26 and measured 0.9 cm on CT of 6/22/09.

Infiltrative disease is seen in the right hilar region, series 5, image 43.  This also demonstrates increased metabolic activity on PET/CT.  There is no left hilar or axillary adenopathy.

Metastatic disease involving the spine as seen on series 5, image 62, is essentially stable.

Findings:  

Multiple contiguous 2.5 mm thick axial images were obtained through the chest without intravenous contrast administration. Comparison is made to the prior CT chest dated 07/11/2007 and 04/04/2007. 

Compared to 07/11/2007, there is stable mild circumferential thickening of the esophagus at the level just superior to the thoracic inlet, best seen on image 12, series 2. This stable finding may represent post-radiation esophageal thickening. The patient is status post right mastectomy. 

No mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy is identified. There is a 3 mm pulmonary nodule seen on image 70 of series 2 in the right middle lobe abutting the anterior mediastinum which demonstrates interval growth compared to the prior exams. This finding could represent a metastasis or a granuloma and continued followup is recommended. The remainder of multiple small scattered nodules through the lungs appear unchanged and may be secondary to benign etiology. There is no pleural effusion. Atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications are noted. No suspicious osseous lesion is seen. 

Evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates a gastrostomy tube in place. The adrenal glands are normal-appearing. There is apparent mild nodularity of the surface of the liver which can be correlated clinically for any evidence of cirrhosis.

Findings:  Upper abdominal structures are intact and there is no primary or metastatic lesion in the liver, spleen, kidneys, or adrenal glands.  Postsurgical cholecystectomy changes noted.  No abdominal or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  Left limb of the adrenal gland is slightly prominent but unchanged from prior films of 10/2008 most likely a small focal adenoma, hyperplasia.  This feature is stable and unchanged going back to July 2007 exam.  Small splenic nodules are also noted, unchanged from prior studies.  


IMPRESSION:  
1.  Bilateral parenchymal and pleural opacities are essentially similar to 10/08/2008 examination except for the slight increase in the left anterior pleural-based nodule noted on image 27, series 2.
2.  Occlusion and thrombosis of the left brachiocephalic/innominate vein with collateral circulation through the anterior and posterior chest wall and reconstitution of the superior vena cava through the azygos and mediastinal circulation.  There is a left subclavian catheter with its tip in the distal superior vena cava level as well through this occluded vein and the distal catheter tip is present within the contrast column, thus most likely patent and the clot is around the more proximal portion of the catheter.  This is noted on this study since there is a left arm injection.

Examination:  CT Chest without Contrast, 01/01/2010

Clinical History:  Lymphangiomatosis. Baseline evaluation. Lung nodules.

Comparison:  Chest CT dated 07/19/2002.

Findings:  There is interval development of right upper lobe, well-circumscribed round, soft tissue nodule that is very low in attenuation (- 3.5 Hounsfield units to -16 Hounsfield units). This nodule is about 13 mm in greatest diameter. The left upper lobe nodule medially remains unchanged in size (7 mm) on image 68. The lungs are otherwise clear.

There are stable, mildly enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes and no evidence of supraclavicular, mediastinal, or hilar adenopathy. The previously identified normal size, pretracheal, AP window, and subcarinal lymph nodes are unchanged in size.  A slightly more prominent lymph node is seen in the right paratracheal region on image 46. There appears to be mildly prominent bilateral internal mammary lymph nodes as seen on images 68 on the right and 72 on the left.New hypodensity in the isthmus of the thyroid gland containing a small calcification is noted, measuring about 1.8 cm. The heart and great vessels are normal in size. The central airways and esophagus appear within normal limits. 

There is interval progression in size of the previously identified low attenuation lesions throughout the liver, with the largest located on segment VI, measuring up to 4 cm, previously about 1.3 cm. A number of new lesions are now identified for example in the left hepatic lobe on image 112, and others throughout the right lobe, such as on images 116, 119, 123 and tiny others. Multiple hypodense lesions occupy the enlarged spleen stable or minimally increased, one of them demonstrates annular calcification on image 139, and multiple other mostly linear calcifications are now seen elsewhere throughout the splenic parenchyma.

Several gallstones are again noted within the gallbladder. There are atrophic changes to the left kidney. The right kidney is not included. The soft tissue density lateral to the aorta on the left is known to represent aneurysm of the left renal vein. Several mildly prominent paraceliac lymph nodes are noted, grossly stable accounting for differences in technique (slice thickness). The visible bowel is within normal limits.

There is progression in size of the soft tissue masses associated with the expansile bony changes in the posterior, superior, and mid lateral chest wall on the right. A basically new mass adjacent to the lateral aspect of the 7th right rib is about 3 x 5 cm in greatest diameter, and progression in size of the mass anterior to the 5th rib medially is noted, from about 2.6 x 4.6 cm to approximately 5.2 x 3.0 cm. The soft tissue component associated with the lesions in the posterior and medial aspect of the left mid lung are also slighlty larger (compare image 69 in the current study with image 19, series 3 in the previous study) The bony changes are likewise slightly  more prominent. 

The size of the largest mass in the left posterior paraspinal region has not significantly changed in the interval, with largest diameters of up to 9 cm. Coarse calcifications within the masses are again seen. The multiple soft tissue lesions elsewhere throughout the posterior aspect of the  back bilaterally associated with serpiginous calcifications are grossly stable.

Laminectomy changes from T3 through T8 are again noted. In some regions, there is narrowing of the spinal canal, for example at the level of T5 and T6, especially, stable in appearance.

Lucencies within the proximal diaphysis of both humeri may be related to infiltrative baseline disease or osteopenia.
  


IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of low attenuation right upper lung nodule. Given its low-density, it could be related to focus of lymphangiomatosis infiltration. The left upper lobe nodule is unchanged and therefore likely benign. Overall, there is progression in size of the multiple extrapleural masses associated with the bony changes throughout the thoracic cage and the bony changes are more prominent. For the right lung nodule and the extrapleural masses even though lymphangiomatosis compromise is an obvious consideration, the fact that there is a newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma, (not confirmed), plasmacytomas is also a potential consideration.

2. The compromise of the soft tissues of the back, especially on the left are grossly stable.

3. New low attenuation lesions are now seen within the liver and the splenic lesions are also more numerous some of them containing calcifications and also possibly related to known baseline disease. 

4. New hypodensity containing a small calcification within the thyroid gland, non-specific.  Infiltration of these organ by the multisystemic disease is a possibility. CT         CT, LUNG, MEDIASTINUM PLEURA

Comparison:  Prior exam dated 09/02/2009.

Technique:  CT of the thorax was performed with IV contrast with 2.5 mm reconstructions. 

Findings:  Postsurgical changes are noted in the sternum. The left upper paratracheal lymphadenopathy previously noted adjacent to the left subclavian and common carotid arteries has been resected.

Postsurgical changes are noted in the anterior mediastinum. There is a new round structure in the anterior mediastinum measuring 1.5 cm (series 3, image 47), adjacent to a sternal wire, and anterior to the pulmonary outflow tract. This finding is nonspecific and in view of recent surgery may represent an organizing postoperative hematoma. The possibility of recurrent disease, however, cannot be excluded, and close attention to this area on subsequent surveillance examinations is required.

No hilar, axillary or subpectoral lymphadenopathy is identified. Stable, partly calcified subcarinal nodes are noted, along with a small granuloma in the right lower lobe, probably related to previous granulomatous infection.

Clinical History: Leukemia  (AML). Pneumonia.  Orthostatic hypertension, also history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and bladder cancer.

Comparison:  11/18/2009.

Findings:  There is worsening of the previously identified nodular airspace opacities throughout both lungs.  Currently, the nodular lesions have become more confluent especially in the lung bases, more noticeable on the right where dense areas of airspace disease are now seen along with surrounding diffuse ground-glass opacities.  The number of nodules is likewise increased throughout both lungs, and the nodules are mostly distributed in a peribronchovascular distribution.  There are new, small bilateral layering pleural effusions, slightly more prominent on the left.  

The previously seen normal-sized pretracheal, right paratracheal, AP window, and subcarinal lymph nodes are at least a few millimeters larger, the largest up to 1.2 cm in short axis.  Calcified lymph nodes are again seen in the right hilum.  The right PICC line remains in the SVC/right atrial junction.  The heart size remains within upper normal limits, and there is decreased density of the blood pool, compatible with anemia.  The pericardium appears normal.  The thyroid gland, central airways and esophagus are within normal limits.

A large stone without evidence of urodynamic defect is again seen in the left kidney.  There are no suspicious focal lesions in the nonenhanced abdomen.  Evaluation of the upper abdominal organs, except for a simple cyst in the right kidney, stable.  A few right retrocrural lymph nodes are again noted on image 124, stable.

There are no visible destructive bony lesions.  Diffuse increased density of the bony structures is again noted, likely related to baseline diagnosis of AML.

  


IMPRESSION: 
1. Worsening of the previously seen bilateral nodular infiltrates suspicious for opportunistic pneumonia including fungal.  More confluent areas of airspace disease in the right lower lobe along with ground-glass opacities are also likely related to worsening infectious process.  Areas of pulmonary hemorrhage is also possible.
2.  New, small bilateral layering pleural effusions.
3.  Although metastatic disease is not completely excluded, rapid progression of the disease, less likely favors this possibility.

Examination:  CT Thorax, 04/24/06

Clinical History:  Fibromyxoid sarcoma of the chest wall, status post chest wall excision and reconstruction.  Surveillance of a right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.

Findings:  A noncontrast enhanced CT scan of the thorax was performed and compared to a previous study from 01/04/06.

1.  In the interval, there has been resection of a soft tissue mass in the left lateral chest wall, and chest reconstruction.  The chest wall wound is opened to the air and packed with gauze.  No evidence of discrete fluid collection.  
2.  Normal heart and mediastinum.  No evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  
3.  In the right lower lobe, there is a 1.2 cm soft tissue nodule which has remained stable since the previous study.  Compared to an earlier study from 10/24/01, this nodule has increased in size (at which time it measured 7 mm in diameter).  This slow enlargement of a pulmonary nodule is consistent either with a slowly enlarging metastasis or an enlarging primary neoplasm such as a carcinoid tumor.
4.  Several other smaller pulmonary nodules predominating in the upper lobes have remained stable and most likely represent scars or granulomas from previous granulomatous infection.  No new pulmonary nodule is seen.  Incidental note is made of surgical clips in the left lower lobe and right upper lobe.
5.  Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.  Incidental note is made of a non-obstructing calculus in the left kidney.  No CT evidence of bone metastasis.


IMPRESSION:  
1.  Interval resection of the left lateral chest wall mass.  
2.  A small noncalcified pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe is unchanged compared to the previous study, but demonstrates definite enlargement compared to a much earlier study from October 2001.  This suggests either a slowly enlarging metastasis or a slowly enlarging primary tumor such as a carcinoid tumor. CT         CT, LUNG, MEDIASTINUM PLEURA

Comparison:  CT examination of the thorax from 02/12/2008. 

Findings:  Compared to 02/12/2008, there has been no significant interval change. There is nodular thickening of the posterior pleura in the right upper lung as seen on images 39 of series 4 that is slightly more prominent than seen before. This remains nonspecific for etiology but may represent some kind of postinflammatory process. There are no pulmonary masses to indicate metastatic disease. No significant lymphadenopathy is seen within the mediastinum or axilla. Surgical clips are seen in the anterior mediastinum. The skeleton is normal for the patients age.

Findings:  CT of the chest was performed with intravenous contrast using 5 mm axial sections and reconstructed at 2.5 mm.  Comparison is made with prior CT chest of January 8, 2007.  Stable postoperative changes related to wedge resection are noted in the left lower lobe including post thoracotomy changes.  There is stable prevascular and right paratracheal and left infrahilar lymph nodes.  There are stable distal paraesophageal lymph nodes as seen on series 3, image 92.  There is no significant hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.

There is biapical scarring.  There are scattered linear opacities from atelectasis.  Focus of ground glass attenuation is seen in the right upper lobe, series 4, image 35, which is stable and may be related to chronic inflammation or infection.  There is an ill-defined nodular opacity in the left upper lobe laterally on series 4, image 56 which also may be related to focus of infection or inflammation and should be followed.  There are stable areas of subsegmental atelectasis within the lower lobes as well as areas of scarring.  Small nodular opacity in the left lower lobe, series 4, image 107, is also likely related to focus of atelectasis and can be followed.  There are no pleural effusions. The right atrium is enlarged.

There are degenerative changes of the spine.  Left upper posterior ribs demonstrate stable deformity and may be also related to postsurgical change.

Findings:  Images were obtained of the thorax without the use intravenous of contrast. Findings are compared to CT of 03/30/2007. 

1. There are bilateral ground-glass nodular pulmonary opacities, the largest with a maximal dimension of 8 mm (image 39, 2.5 mm collimation) that are unchanged since CT of 04/14/2003. There are no new nodular pulmonary opacities. 

2. There are post-surgical changes in the right hemithorax consistent with given clinical history of resection of the right upper lobe. Post-surgical changes are stable. 

3. There are no enlarged intrathoracic lymph nodes. 

4. There is an anomalous right subclavian artery. 

5. There is coronary artery calcification consistent with sequela of atherosclerosis.

Clinical History:  Patient with a history of recurrent atypical lipomatous tumor, assess.  

Findings:  CT chest performed without iodine secondary to elevated BUN and creatinine.  There is no prior chest CT.  Computer review indicates that patient had surgical procedure for removal of atypical lipomatous tumor of the left upper extremity as well as the left axilla.  Female patient is noted to be 87-years-of-age and no asymmetry is seen in the left axilla relative to the right in follow-up today.  Further, the lungs appear clear of any acute process and under the assumption that this atypical lipomatous tumor might metastasize, no such metastasis is seen within the lung parenchyma.  Even when allowing for lack of iodine, there is nothing to suspect pathological, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Vascular calcification certainly noted in this 87-year-old female.  Upper abdomen included on this chest CT shows no definite abnormalities.  Much of the left kidney is observed.  Only the top of the right kidney is seen.  Correlation recommended with respect to elevated BUN and creatinine in regard to potential renal dysfunction.

Examination:  Chest CT  03/10/2009 

Clinical History:  Breast malignancy.  

Findings:  Images were obtained of the thorax following intravenous administration of contrast.  Findings are compared to CT of 02/02/2008.

1.  Previously visualized nodular opacities consistent with metastatic lung disease are either stable or have decreased further in size in the interval.  For instance there is minimal residual abnormality in the region of prior right upper lobe metastasis (image 33, 2.5 mm collimation), previously 1-1.5 cm on CT of 12/02/2008 and 2.5-3 cm on CT of 09/25/2008.  In addition left upper lobe nodule (image 30, 2.5 mm collimation) now has a maximal dimension of 1-2 mm, previously 3 mm on CT of 12/02/2008 and 7-8 mm on CT of 09/25/2008.

2.  Left breast mass (image 62, 2.5 mm collimation) has decreased in size and now has a maximal dimension of 10 cm, previously greater than 13 cm.  In addition there has been decrease in previously visualized enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla.  There is residual adenopathy in the left axilla.  Largest left axillary lymph node now has a maximal dimension of 2-2.5 cm, previously 3 cm.  

3.  There has been interval increase in sclerosis of the transverse process of the T2 vertebral body consistent with healing response of metastatic bone disease.  

4.  Limited images of the liver are normal.

5.  The right adrenal is normal.  Nodule in the left adrenal consistent with an adenoma is unchanged.  


IMPRESSION:  
There has been further decrease in size of pulmonary metastases.  There are residua of treated metastatic disease in both lungs.  Osseous metastasis has undergone interval development of sclerosis consistent with healing response.  Large left breast mass consistent with primary malignancy and associated nodal metastatic disease within the left axilla demonstrates partial response to therapy.

Pseudotumor of the right orbit and basilar cell carcinoma as well.  History of right breast mass.  No evidence of malignancy when this underwent left breast lumpectomy.  Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy for endometriosis.  Questionable C4 cervical lesion.  History of left upper lobe nodule.  Follow-up.  

Findings:  CT of the chest performed with IV contrast is compared to the prior study of 3/23/06.  

There is an enhancing nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid.  I am concerned this has increased in size, and clinical correlation would be suggested.  Consideration should be made for evaluation with Nuclear Medicine scan and/or ultrasound.  Nodule now measures 1.4 x 1.8 cm.  Previously, there was a nodule that measured 1.5 x 0.9 cm on 3/23/06. It is difficult to compare with the outside study of 5/11/04 because it was scanned from film and I cannot calibrate the measuring tool to precisely measure the lesion. While qualitatively it appears similar in size to todays study, quantitatively in appears to have measured maximally on 1.5cm.  

No axillary adenopathy.  No mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.  No pleural effusions.  There is a stable small nodule in the lateral apex seen on image 22 of series 8.  There are two punctate nodular foci seen in the anterolateral right apex on image 16 of series 8.  They are stable from the prior study.  They also appear to be stable from the study of 5/11/04.  Given the stability over approximately two years, a benign etiology is favored such as granulomas.  No definite new pulmonary nodules are seen.  


IMPRESSION:  
1.  Findings of concern for possibly increasing size of lesion in the left lobe of the thyroid. Other nodules appear to be present and findings may be representative of multinodular goiter.  Clinical correlation is suggested.  Evaluation of nuclear medicine studies, and/or ultrasound would be useful.   
2.  Stable appearance of tiny pulmonary nodules.  These appear to be stable on examination dating back to 5/11/04, which indicate that they probably represent benign etiology such as granulomatous disease. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST

Clinical History:  Breast cancer. Question lung metastatic disease. Staging. 

Findings:  There is a peripherally enhancing lobulated mass in the left breast compatible with a primary breast cancer greater than 5.8 cm in diameter noted on images 46 through images 65 and abuts the skin surface. There are numerous subcentimeter axillary nodes bilaterally. These may be reactive in view of small size and follow up can be performed. Enlarged nodes are present in the right paratracheal station, image 15, and in the lower paratracheal station borderline nodes are noted on image 38. The appearance of metastatic adenopathy to the right paratracheal station would be a sole manifestation of metastatic disease. Metastasis to the region cannot be entirely excluded. A tiny nodule in the right lower lobe is unlikely to represent a metastatic focus and more likely represents a noncalcified granuloma, though follow up can be performed. 

No pleural effusions are present. Limited imaging of the abdomen shows no focal liver lesions. 

There is a gallstone noted in the gallbladder. The adrenal glands are not enlarged. 

The clinical  treating physician, Dr. Ibrahim, was informed of the findings by e-mail at the time of dictation at 2 p.m., 01/12/2009.

1. There is a peripherally enhancing mass involving the left breast greater than 5.8 cm in diameter compatible with a primary breast cancer. 
2. There are nonspecific enlarged nodes in the right paratracheal station 1.3 cm in short axis diameter. The appearance of enlarged nodes in the mediastinum as a sole manifestation of metastatic disease would be an unusual presentation though metastatic disease cannot be excluded. A single pulmonary nodule is noted in the right lower lobe and is nonspecific and may be due to an intraparenchymal lymph node, noncalcified granuloma, or less likely a metastatic focus.

Comparison:  Chest CT from 04/02/2009 and chest MRI from 08/27/2009, PET/CT from 08/26/2009.

Clinical History:  A 74-year-old female with history of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and left shoulder disarticulation on 09/18/2009, bilateral breast cancer with bilateral mastectomy, uterine clear cell carcinoma status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

Technique:  CT images of the chest were obtained after administration of intravenous contrast.

Findings:  Nodules in the right lung are again seen on series 4, images 22, 39, 41, 57, 60, 69, measuring up to 6 mm in diameter; unchanged significantly since prior exam. There is a new nodule in the right lung seen on series 4, image 34. The differential includes sequela of previous infection with scarring versus metastatic disease. There is volume loss in the left upper lobe with bronchiectatic changes and areas of scarring consistent with previous radiation therapy.

There is no evidence of pericardial or pleural effusions.

Enlarged precarinal lymph nodes seen on prior exam are somewhat less prominent currently. For example, a lymph node on series 3, image 41 currently measures 0.6 x 0.7 cm and was 0.9 x 1.0 cm on prior exam. These lymph nodes can be further followed on subsequent imaging.

There is a 1.2 cm hypoattenuating nodule in the right thyroid lobe. If necessary, this can be further evaluated with ultrasound exam.

The patient is status post bilateral mastectomies. The patient also had recently, on 09/18/2009, left limb disarticulation with fasciocutaneous flap coverage. There is edematous appearance of the muscles in the area of fasciocutaneous flap, likely representing post-surgical changes. Clinical correlation is advised.

The patient is status post median sternotomy and 2-vessel coronary artery bypass. Moderate coronary artery calcifications are seen.

The bones appear demineralized without destructive osseous lesions.

  


IMPRESSION:
1. Scattered right lung nodules, stable since prior exam with a single new nodule in the right upper lobe. Differential diagnosis includes infection versus metastatic disease.
2. Improvement in prominent mediastinal lymph nodes.
3. Edematous appearance of the muscles in the area of fasciocutaneous flap in patient status post recent left limb disarticulation likely represents post-surgical changes. Clinical correlation is advised. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST

Clinical History:  Nonsmall cell lung cancer of left lower lobe that was treated with left lower lobe lobectomy.  Radiation therapy was also performed and completed March 2001.  

Findings:  CT of the chest was performed with intravenous contrast and correlated with the 7-22-05 examination.  There are no pleural effusions.  Focal defect of the left kidney is again noted.

The right adrenal gland lesion that is 1.5 cm in size is unchanged.  A few areas of calcification are noted within this.

A 1.5 cm low-attenuation lesion in the liver is unchanged.  No new liver lesions are noted.

Cystic lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid is stable.  


IMPRESSION:  
1.  Interval development of a number of tiny (2-3 mm) nodules throughout the left lower lobe and right lung.  The right lung nodules are on image 30, 34, and 42 as examples.  These findings are certainly concerning for metastatic disease although superimposed infectious process may present in this manner and followup is warranted.
2.  New patchy opacities in the left posterior sulcus that appear more inflammatory in nature.  This could represent a pneumonia or an aspiration pneumonitis.
3.  Stable radiation fibrosis and therapeutic changes from left upper lobe lobectomy of the left are noted.  
4.  There is development of partial collapse of the apical aspect of the lower lobe with resultant volume loss in the left hemithorax. A distinct lesion or mucus plug within the airway to explain this is not apparent. However, recurrent tumor in this region is not excluded. Evaluation with bronchoscopy might be needed for further considerations. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST

The bony structures are intact, and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  No lymphadenopathy in the hilum or mediastinum.  Postsurgical changes are noted in the anterior chest.  It is important to note that these nodules, even though they have changed since 7/5/06, they are not as prominent as the nodules in size and number as on prior study from 6/3/04.  However, there are new nodules present as illustrated in the right lower lobe. 


IMPRESSION:  
1.  Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules are again noted.  Several of these nodules are stable as illustrated in the left lower lobe, but some are new as illustrated in the right lower lobe.  Nodules have been present with a variation in presentation patterns going back to June 2004 and still remain indeterminate.  It is unlikely that neoplasm would have this 3-year up-and-down course, thus inflammatory disease should be considered; but these nodules still remain indeterminate.

Technique:     Axial images obtained with contrast are compared with 29 February 2008. 

Findings:  

Numerous pulmonary nodules are again present bilaterally. Many of them appear stable. At least a few are larger, however. One in  superior segment of the left lower lobe now measures 20 mm in diameter compared with 19 mm previously. One in the right upper lobe now measures 10 mm compared with 8 mm previously. One in the superior segment of the right lower lobe now measures 25 mm compared previously with 21 mm. Another in the right lower lobe now measures 11 mm compared previously with 9 mm. 

There is degenerative change in spine, but no lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified to suggest bony metastatic disease. Bilateral breast implants with capsular calcification are present. The right breast implant is either excessively lobulated or perhaps ruptured. MRI may be helpful for further evaluation if clinically indicated. This appearance is not changed. 

There is probable right hilar adenopathy that appears increased. As the contrast was originally given for a CT of the neck, however, the enhancement of the vessels is suboptimal for evaluation of the hilar regions.

Findings:  Spiral CT of the chest was performed with 2.5-mm collimation without intravenous contrast.  Right mastectomy changes are seen.  Cardiac chamber sizes are normal with mild LAD coronary artery calcifications.  There are a number of small mediastinal lymph nodes throughout the mediastinum and no obvious hilar lymph nodes and no definitely enlarged nodes.  There are some small nodular pulmonary lesions scattered in both lungs.  These are in the 3-5 mm range of size such as on image 23 on the left and 38 on the right.  They are unchanged back to least January 2007 and no new or growing nodules are seen.  This focal area of ground glass opacity in right costophrenic sulcus is probably some scarring and some fibrosis along the lower thoracic spine posteriorly.  No new consolidation an no effusion.

Examination:  CT Chest with Contrast, 10/07/2009

Comparison:  CT thorax from 07/01/2009, 02/25/2009, 10/08/2008 and 11/06/2007.

Clinical History:  A 30-year-old female with history of breast carcinoma with pulmonary nodal metastasis.  The patient is currently on chemotherapy and CT is ordered to evaluate disease status.

Technique:  CT images of the chest were obtained after administration of intravenous contrast.

Findings:  Since prior exam from 07/25/2009, there is interval increase in prominence of areas of pleural-based nodularity in the right hemithorax. For example, pleurally based nodule in the right lower lobe (series 6, image 107) currently measures 1.3 x 0.9 cm. It was about 0.6 cm on prior exam. Another nodule at the right hemidiaphragm (series 6, image 101) currently measures 0.6 mm, and was hardly visible on prior study. There is increased prominence of the nodules along the right minor fissure (series 6, images 47 and 48). These findings are suggestive of progression of pleurally based metastatic disease.

Postradiation changes are again seen in the bilateral upper lungs. There is a stable 2.3 x 1.2 cm circumscribed oval mass in the left anterior chest wall unchanged since 11/06/2007 exam and likely representing a benign pleural-based tumor such as fibrous tumor of pleura. Pleurally based opacification with calcification within it seen in the right upper lobe (series 6, image 62) likely treated metastasis.

There is no evidence of mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy. No enlarged internal mammary lymph nodes are seen. There is interval increase in size of the anterior diaphragmatic lymph node (series 5, image 88) which currently measures 1 x 0.7 cm and was 0.7 x 0.5 cm on prior exam.

The patient is status post bilateral mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and status post breast reconstruction surgery.

There is a stable sclerotic metastatic lesion involving most of the sternum  Stable since prior exams sclerotic focus with deformity seen at the anterior aspect of the right 4th rib (series 5, image 48). This may be related to prior trauma versus metastatic disease. Sclerotic area is seen in the right clavicle (series 5, image 6) and a metastatic lesion cannot be excluded, correlation with nuclear medicine bone scan is advised.
  


IMPRESSION:
1. Progression of pleurally based metastatic disease in the right hemithorax since prior exam.
2. Osseous metastatic disease as described. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST

35799517 FULL RESULT:  
Examination:  CT Chest 

Clinical History:  Acinic cell carcinoma. 

Findings:  CT chest, IV contrast, compared to 11/01/06. 

Subcarinal necrotic-appearing adenopathy has decreased, now measuring 2.1 x 1.2cm compared to 2.2 x 1.7cm previously. Again seen are coronary artery calcifications of concern for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. No hilar or axillary adenopathy. Small hiatal hernia is visualized. No pleural effusions. 

Again seen and incompletely visualized is a large destructive lesion involving the right scapula with extensive regions of permeation and probably destruction of the right glenoid which may have progressed since the prior study. The tumor itself is poorly visualized and difficult to differentiate from the adjacent musculature. It appears probably decreased in size but it is incompletely seen as it extends beyond the field of view on the right posteriorly. Overall, it appeared that previously it measured at least 7.5 x 7.9cm;  now, it appears to measure at least 4.6 x 6.6cm. Again seen are extensive permeative changes involving a thoracic spine vertebral body, image 67, series 2, which appear to be grossly stable with also areas of blastic change. Also again seen are bilateral pulmonary metastases. That in the left lower lobe seen on image 87 of series 3 has decreased, measuring 7mm compared to 9mm on the prior study. Other pulmonary metastases are probably slightly improved or stable. The right lower lobe mass seen on image 82 of series 3 measures 1.2cm compared to 1.4cm on the prior study. Again seen is cavitation of a nodule in the medial right lower lobe, image 64. 


IMPRESSION:  

1. Improvement of disease. 

2. Slight decrease in size of some of the multiple pulmonary metastases. 

3. Decrease in size of destructive lesion involving the right scapula. While there are findings of concern for greater permeation of the glenoid of the right shoulder, the overall extent of the mass appears to be smaller though it is difficult to differentiate from adjacent musculature and is incompletely visualized. 

4. Decrease in size of what is probably necrotic adenopathy in the subcarinal region. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST

Comparison:  Chest CT on 07/08/2009.

Findings:  The previously seen extensive subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum have resolved.

Note is made of the apical scarring with traction bronchiectasis. Focal areas of bronchiectasis are seen throughout both lungs, most prominent in the right middle lobe and lingula associated with focal consolidative opacities. 

New peripheral nodular opacities are seen in the right lower lobe and may represent infectious inflammatory process or metastatic disease.

There is no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.

The heart is normal in size and there is no pericardial or pleural effusion.

Limited imaging through the upper abdomen shows no evidence of metastatic disease to the liver or adrenal glands.
