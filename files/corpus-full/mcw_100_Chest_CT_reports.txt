CT THORAX AND CT PELVIS (858A-B): CT EXAMINATION OF THE CHEST WAS PERFORMED ACCORDING TO PULMONARY EMBOLISM PROTOCOL. COMPARISON: CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS DATED [date]. TECHNIQUE: HELICAL THIN SECTION IMAGING WAS OBTAINED THROUGH THE CHEST DURING RAPID ADMINISTRATION OF NONIONIC CONTRAST, AND DELAYED NONCONTIGUOUS IMAGES WERE OBTAINED THROUGH THE PELVIS AND PROXIMAL PORTIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. 121 CC OF OMNI-350 WAS USED. FINDINGS: THERE IS GRAVITY DEPENDENT ATELECTASIS IN THE LUNG BASES. NEW PATCHY AREAS OF CONSOLIDATION IN THE LEFT LOWER LOBE ARE SUSPICIOUS FOR ASPIRATION VS. ATELECTASIS. THERE IS AN INCIDENTAL PNEUMATOCELE IN THE MEDIAL BASAL SEGMENT OF THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE ON IMAGE #114. HEART SIZE IS NORMAL. NO PLEURAL OR PERICARDIAL EFFUSIONS. NO MEDIASTINAL OR HILAR LYMPHADENOPATHY. THERE IS A FOCAL FILLING DEFECT SEEN IN A SUBSEGMENTAL BRANCH OF THE SUPERIOR SEGMENT OF THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE PULMONARY ARTERY THAT IS ONLY VISIBLE ON ONE IMAGE. THIS IS IN AN AREA OF RESPIRATORY MOTION AND NOT CORROBORATED ON THE SAGITTAL AND CORONAL REFORMATTED IMAGES. THIS IS MOST LIKELY SECONDARY VOLUME AVERAGING WITH THE ADJACENT PULMONARY VESSEL WALL. NO OTHER FOCAL FILLING DEFECTS ARE SEEN TO SUGGEST PULMONARY EMBOLISM. DENSE CONSOLIDATION AND MOTION ARTIFACT, PARTICULARLY IN THE LEFT BASE, COULD OBSCURE A SMALL SUBSEGMENTAL PULMONARY EMBOLISM. THERE IS RESIDUAL THYMIC TISSUE IN THE SUPERIOR MEDIASTINUM. PROMINENT INTRA AND EXTRAHEPATIC BILIARY DUCTS ARE AGAIN NOTED. THIS MAY BE A NORMAL VARIANT. IMAGES OF THE REST OF THE UPPER ABDOMEN ARE OTHERWISE UNREMARKABLE. A FOLEY CATHETER IS IN A DECOMPRESSED BLADDER. NO DVT. NO OSSEOUS DESTRUCTIVE LESIONS ARE IDENTIFIED. THERE IS AN INTRAMEDULLARY ROD PARTIALLY VISUALIZED IN THE PROXIMAL RIGHT TIBIA.
1. NO EVIDENCE OF PE OR DVT. A SMALL SUBSEGMENTAL PE CANNOT ENTIRELY BE EXCLUDED IN THE BASAL SEGMENTS OF THE LEFT LOWER LOBE SECONDARY TO MOTION ARTIFACT AND ADJACENT CONSOLIDATION. 2. PATCHY AREAS OF CONSOLIDATION IN THE LEFT LOWER LOBE, MOST LIKELY SECONDARY TO ASPIRATION VERSUS ATELECTASIS. 3. STABLE PROMINENT INTRA AND EXTRAHEPATIC BILIARY DUCTS OF UNCERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE.

FINDINGS: THE OPACIFICATION OF THE PULMONARY VESSELS IS SATISFACTORY. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ACUTE OR CHRONIC PULMONARY EMBOLISM. THE GREAT VESSELS ARE NORMAL IN CALIBER AND COURSE. THERE IS RESIDUAL THYMIC TISSUE IN THE SUPERIOR MEDIASTINUM. NO LYMPHADENOPATHY IS DEMONSTRATED IN THE AXILLARY REGION, PULMONARY HILA, OR MEDIASTINUM. THE HEART IS MILDLY ENLARGED. THERE IS NO PERICARDIAL EFFUSION. THERE ARE PATCHY AREAS OF GROUND-GLASS OPACITY, AND MILD INTERLOBULAR SEPTAL THICKENING ALONG WITH MINIMAL LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION. THESE FINDINGS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH EARLY INFLAMMATORY/INFECTIOUS PROCESS, PARTICULARLY VIRAL PNEUMONIA. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT PULMONARY VASCULAR CONGESTION OR PERIBRONCHOVASCULAR EDEMA, VERY EARLY CARDIOGENIC PULMONARY EDEMA CAN ALSO BE A CONSIDERATION. IMAGES THROUGH THE UPPER ABDOMEN DEMONSTRATE NO ABNORMALITIES IN THE VISUALIZED PORTION OF THE SOLID ORGANS INCLUDING THE ADRENAL GLANDS. IMAGES THROUGH THE LOWER EXTREMITIES REVEAL NO ACUTE OR CHRONIC DVT IN THE SUPERFICIAL FEMORAL VEIN, COMMON FEMORAL VEIN, OR EXTERNAL ILIAC VEINS. THERE IS A QUESTIONABLE LUMINAL DEFECT BELOW THE BIFURCATION OF THE POPLITEAL VEIN ON THE RIGHT SIDE. THIS COULD BE DUE TO AN ARTIFACT, HOWEVER, A SMALL CLOT CANNOT BE COMPLETELY EXCLUDED. IF CLINICALLY WARRANTED, AN ULTRASOUND OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY IN 48 TO 72 HOURS SHOULD PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION. NO BONY ABNORMALITIES ARE IDENTIFIED. THERE IS BILATERAL GYNECOMASTIA.

THE PRIOR EXAM DEMONSTRATED A SMALL MULTILOCULATED FLUID COLLECTION LATERAL TO THE JEJUNAL LIMB AND MEDIAL TO THE INFERIOR RIGHT HEPATIC LOBE. THE PATIENT HAD A PERCUTANEOUS TRANSHEPATIC INTERNAL/EXTERNAL BILIARY STENT INTO THE HEPATICOJEJUNOSTOMY. PERCUTANEOUS GASTROSTOMY WAS NOTED. THE CURRENT EXAMINATION IS PERFORMED USING HELICAL ACQUISITION WITH 2.5 MM IMAGE THICKNESS. THE PATIENT RECEIVED INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST MATERIAL (VISIPAQUE 120 ML). SERUM CREATININE OF 1.6 MG% IS NOTED. SINCE THE PRIOR STUDY, THE TRANSHEPATIC INTERNAL/EXTERNAL BILIARY STENT HAS BEEN REMOVED. PNEUMOBILIA NOTED, AS EXPECTED. THERE IS NO INTRAHEPATIC BILIARY DILATATION. THERE IS A LARGE VOLUME OF FREE INTRAPERITONEAL FLUID DISTRIBUTED IN ALL COMPARTMENTS. THE DISTAL GASTRIC ANTRUM IS NOTED OPPOSED TO THE PANCREAS AT THE PRESUMED SITE OF THE PANCREATICOGASTROSTOMY. THE PREVIOUSLY NOTED SMALL MULTILOCULATED COLLECTION LATERAL TO THE JEJUNAL LIMB AND MEDIAL TO THE INFERIOR RIGHT HEPATIC LOBE APPEARS TO HAVE RESOLVED. THE HEPATIC AND PORTAL VEINS ARE PATENT. THE SPLENIC AND SUPERIOR MESENTERIC VEINS ARE ALSO PATENT. NO FOCAL ABNORMALITY IS DETECTED IN THE LIVER, SPLEEN, OR PANCREATIC REMNANT. ADRENAL GLANDS ARE NORMAL IN SIZE AND CONTOUR.
