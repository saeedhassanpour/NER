39265561 FULL RESULT:
Examination:  CT Examination of Thorax with Contrast, 10/13/2009. 

Clinical History:  Rectal carcinoma.

Technique:  Following intravenous contrast, CT examination of the thorax was performed.

Comparison:  CT examination of the thorax from 04/14/2009.

Findings:  Compared to 04/14/2009, there has been no significant interval change.  There is no evidence of metastatic disease in the thorax. Chronic pleural thickening in the posterior superior aspect of the right lower lung is seen on image 39 of series 4 that is stable.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The heart and great vessels are normal.  Surgical clips are seen in a substernal location.  No pathologically enlarged lymphadenopathy is seen in mediastinum or axilla.  Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic skeleton compatible with the patients age.
  
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of metastatic disease in the thorax.  No interval change compared to 04/14/2009. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST

39674443 FULL RESULT:  
Examination:  Chest CT without Intravenous Contrast, 02/01/2010 

Comparison:  10/06/2009 

Clinical History:  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Findings:  

Interval development of right lower lobe lung ground-glass and airspace opacities as well as bilateral mild pleural effusions, somewhat loculated with intrafissural component in the right side. Increased irregular opacity in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe now measuring  1.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter and previously measuring 1 x 0.8 cm.

Focal opacities in the right middle lobe airspace may represent focal atelectasis and/or scarring tissue. Bilateral apical pleural parenchymal scarring is also noted. Bilateral calcified nodules most likely represent granulomatous infectious disease.

Stable multicompartment mediastinal enlarged lymph nodes, most evident in the left paratracheal region and paraaortic region.

Atherosclerosis of the aorta and coronary arteries is also noted.

The heart size is in the upper limits of normal. 

Stable right liver hypodense lesion measuring 1.4 cm in diameter and most likely representing a cyst. Retroperitoneal enlarged lymph nodes measuring up to 2 cm in diameter are stable. The right kidney is somewhat atrophic, and left parapelvic renal cysts are again noted. Left adrenal nodular thickening is stable. Cholecystectomy changes are also noted. Small size of the spleen without evidence of focal abnormalities.

Left thyroid gland calcifications and nodule are again noted.

There is no evidence of destructive lesions.

  


IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval development of right lower lobe lung opacities that may represent inflammatory/infectious process.
2.  Irregular nodular-like opacity in the right upper lobe, of indeterminate etiology. Followup is recommended. 
3.  Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, somewhat loculated in the right side.
4.  Stable mediastinal and retroperitoneal adenopathy. CT         CT, LUNG, MEDIASTINUM PLEURA

Examination:  Contrast-Enhanced Chest CT, 05/15/2008 

Compared to 12/12/2007. 

Clinical History:  Right lung cancer status post right upper lobectomy on 10/02/2007.  

Findings:  

1.  In the interval the patient has had a right upper lobectomy.  Previous appearance of the right chest wall from previous right mastectomy is stable.  There are no pulmonary nodules. 

2.  There is no supraclavicular, mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.  There is a tiny stable right pleural effusion. 

3.  Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a partially imaged stable low-attenuation lesion in the pancreas on image #111.  The adrenal glands appear normal.  Liver cysts are stable. 

4.  There is no evidence of any bony destructive process.  


IMPRESSION:  
1.  No evidence of recurrence of disease.
2.  Low-attenuation lesion within the pancreas could be benign or represent a small intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.  Attention on follow up recommended. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST

Examination:  CT of the chest with IV contrast, June 8, 2007.  

Clinical History:  Stage III colon carcinoma for restaging.  

Findings:  CT of the chest was performed with intravenous contrast and compared to April 6, 2006.

No hilar, mediastinal, or axillary adenopathy is appreciated.  Scaring is seen in both apices. The lungs are otherwise clear.  No suspicious osseous lesions are seen.

Examination:  CT Chest Without Contrast, 12/05/2008.

Clinical History:  Hodgkin lymphoma.

Findings:  CT of the chest was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast. Comparison is made to the prior study of 02/07/2008.
