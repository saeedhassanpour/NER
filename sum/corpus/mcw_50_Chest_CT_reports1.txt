PER PE PROTOCOL
CT THORAX AND CT PELVIS (858A-B): CT EXAMINATION OF THE CHEST WAS PERFORMED ACCORDING TO PULMONARY EMBOLISM PROTOCOL. COMPARISON: CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS DATED [date]. TECHNIQUE: HELICAL THIN SECTION IMAGING WAS OBTAINED THROUGH THE CHEST DURING RAPID ADMINISTRATION OF NONIONIC CONTRAST, AND DELAYED NONCONTIGUOUS IMAGES WERE OBTAINED THROUGH THE PELVIS AND PROXIMAL PORTIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. 121 CC OF OMNI-350 WAS USED. FINDINGS: THERE IS GRAVITY DEPENDENT ATELECTASIS IN THE LUNG BASES. NEW PATCHY AREAS OF CONSOLIDATION IN THE LEFT LOWER LOBE ARE SUSPICIOUS FOR ASPIRATION VS. ATELECTASIS. THERE IS AN INCIDENTAL PNEUMATOCELE IN THE MEDIAL BASAL SEGMENT OF THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE ON IMAGE #114. HEART SIZE IS NORMAL. NO PLEURAL OR PERICARDIAL EFFUSIONS. NO MEDIASTINAL OR HILAR LYMPHADENOPATHY. THERE IS A FOCAL FILLING DEFECT SEEN IN A SUBSEGMENTAL BRANCH OF THE SUPERIOR SEGMENT OF THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE PULMONARY ARTERY THAT IS ONLY VISIBLE ON ONE IMAGE. THIS IS IN AN AREA OF RESPIRATORY MOTION AND NOT CORROBORATED ON THE SAGITTAL AND CORONAL REFORMATTED IMAGES. THIS IS MOST LIKELY SECONDARY VOLUME AVERAGING WITH THE ADJACENT PULMONARY VESSEL WALL. NO OTHER FOCAL FILLING DEFECTS ARE SEEN TO SUGGEST PULMONARY EMBOLISM. DENSE CONSOLIDATION AND MOTION ARTIFACT, PARTICULARLY IN THE LEFT BASE, COULD OBSCURE A SMALL SUBSEGMENTAL PULMONARY EMBOLISM. THERE IS RESIDUAL THYMIC TISSUE IN THE SUPERIOR MEDIASTINUM. PROMINENT INTRA AND EXTRAHEPATIC BILIARY DUCTS ARE AGAIN NOTED. THIS MAY BE A NORMAL VARIANT. IMAGES OF THE REST OF THE UPPER ABDOMEN ARE OTHERWISE UNREMARKABLE. A FOLEY CATHETER IS IN A DECOMPRESSED BLADDER. NO DVT. NO OSSEOUS DESTRUCTIVE LESIONS ARE IDENTIFIED. THERE IS AN INTRAMEDULLARY ROD PARTIALLY VISUALIZED IN THE PROXIMAL RIGHT TIBIA.
1. NO EVIDENCE OF PE OR DVT. A SMALL SUBSEGMENTAL PE CANNOT ENTIRELY BE EXCLUDED IN THE BASAL SEGMENTS OF THE LEFT LOWER LOBE SECONDARY TO MOTION ARTIFACT AND ADJACENT CONSOLIDATION. 2. PATCHY AREAS OF CONSOLIDATION IN THE LEFT LOWER LOBE, MOST LIKELY SECONDARY TO ASPIRATION VERSUS ATELECTASIS. 3. STABLE PROMINENT INTRA AND EXTRAHEPATIC BILIARY DUCTS OF UNCERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE. THIS MAY REPRESENT A NORMAL VARIANT. CORRELATE CLINICALLY. + EXAMINATION REVIEWED AND REPORTED FINDINGS CONFIRMED BY: [doctor].
