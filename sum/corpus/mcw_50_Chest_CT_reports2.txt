TRAUMA
CT ANGIO CHEST, CT LIVER/SPLEEN, CT PELVIS, THORACIC RECONSTRUCTIONS AND LUMBAR RECONSTRUCTIONS (250C-G). AXIAL IMAGES OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WERE OBTAINED AFTER THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF 145 CC OF OMNIPAQUE 300. SAGITTAL REFORMATS OF THE THORACIC AORTA, THORACIC SPINE AND LUMBAR SPINE WERE PERFORMED. THE AORTA AND GREAT VESSELS ARE INTACT. THERE IS NO MEDIASTINAL HEMATOMA. THERE IS NO PLEURAL OR PERICARDIAL FLUID. AIR IS NOTED IN THE SOFT TISSUES AT THE RIGHT ANTERIOR NECK BASE IN MUSCLE AND ADJACENT TO THE CAROTID SHEATH REGION. PATCHY OPACITIES WITH AREAS OF TREE-IN-BUD OPACITIES ARE SEEN IN THE RIGHT UPPER, RIGHT MIDDLE AND RIGHT LOWER LOBES. THE LEFT LUNG IS CLEAR. THE LIVER, SPLEEN, PANCREAS, ADRENALS AND KIDNEYS ARE NORMAL. NO FREE FLUID OR AIR IS IDENTIFIED. THE VISUALIZED BOWEL AND MESENTERY APPEAR NORMAL. NO MESENTERIC OR RETROPERITONEAL ADENOPATHY. THE BLADDER IS INTACT. A FOLEY CATHETER IS SEEN IN SATISFACTORY POSITION. REVIEW OF OSSEOUS STRUCTURES SHOWS NO ACUTE FRACTURES.
1 PATCHY ALVEOLAR OPACITIES IN THE RIGHT LUNG WHICH ARE SOMEWHAT NONSPECIFIC. THESE COULD BE POST-INFLAMMATORY, RELATED TO ASPIRATION OR CONTUSIONS. 2. NO FINDINGS TO SUGGEST SOLID INTRA-ABDOMINAL ORGAN INJURY 3. INTACT THORACIC AORTA. 4. SOFT TISSUE AIR IN THE RIGHT ANTERIOR LOWER NECK REGION. + EXAMINATION REVIEWED & REPORTED FINDINGS CONFIRMED BY: [doctor]. HOHENWALTER.

UTERINE SARCOMA
CT THORAX, CT LIVER/SPLEEN AND CT PELVIS (#276A-B-C): COMPARISON: [date] TECHNIQUE: HELICAL ACQUISITION WAS PERFORMED AFTER THE ORAL AND RECTAL ADMINISTRATION OF CONTRAST MATERIAL AND THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF 140 CC OF OMNIPAQUE-300 AND 2.5 MM AXIAL IMAGES ARE REVIEWED. FINDINGS: THE MULTIPLE PULMONARY NODULES ARE MORE NUMEROUS AND LARGER IN SIZE. FOR INSTANCE THE MASS IN THE ANTERIOR SEGMENT OF THE RIGHT UPPER LOBE NOW HAS A MAXIMUM DIAMETER OF 3.5 CM VERSUS 2.5 CM ON PRIOR STUDY. ON THAT SAME IMAGE ON PRIOR EXAM SEVERAL PUNCTATE NODULES WERE VISUALIZED AS WELL AS LARGER NODULES UP TO 1 CM IN SIZE. THERE ARE NOW 10 TO 15 NODULES SEEN IN THE RIGHT UPPER LOBE VARYING FROM PUNCTATE TO OVER 2 CM IN ADDITION TO THE LARGE ANTERIOR NODULE. THE VISUALIZED STRUCTURES AT THE BASE OF THE NECK ARE UNREMARKABLE. THERE IS NO AXILLARY ADENOPATHY. THERE IS NO PLEURAL OR PERICARDIAL EFFUSION. NO MEDIASTINAL ADENOPATHY IS SEEN. THE LIVER IS UNREMARKABLE. THE PATIENT IS STATUS POST CHOLECYSTECTOMY. THE EXTRAHEPATIC BILE DUCT IS MILDLY ENLARGED BUT UNCHANGED. MULTIPLE SURGICAL CLIPS ARE SEEN IN THE UPPER ABDOMEN. THE SPLEEN HAS MULTIPLE CALCIFIED GRANULOMATA. THE PANCREAS SHOWS NO MASS OR DUCT DILATATION. THE ADRENALS AND KIDNEYS ARE UNREMARKABLE. THE MESENTERIC STRANDING AND SMALL COLLECTIONS OF FLUID HAVE ESSENTIALLY RESOLVED. THERE HAS BEEN PARTIAL HEALING OF THE MIDLINE INCISION. THE BOWEL LOOPS ARE UNREMARKABLE. NO ABDOMINAL OR PELVIC ADENOPATHY IS SEEN. ADVANCED DEGENERATIVE CHANGES ARE SEEN OF THE RIGHT HIP. BILATERAL CARTILAGE CALCIFICATIONS ARE SEEN. THERE ARE NO BONE LESIONS SUSPICIOUS FOR METASTATIC DISEASE. THERE IS APPARENT MASS OR FULLNESS IN THE REGION OF THE VAGINA. THIS IS MORE PRONOUNCED THAN ON THE PRIOR EXAM AND CLINICAL CORRELATION IS RECOMMENDED.
1. INCREASE IN SIZE AND NUMBER OF PULMONARY NODULES INDICATING PROGRESSION OF METASTATIC DISEASE. 2. DECREASE IN THE POSTOPERATIVE CHANGES IN THE LOWER ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN FURTHER HEALING OF THE ABDOMINAL WALL INCISION. 3. SOME INCREASE IN THE TISSUES BETWEEN THE RECTUM AND THE SYMPHYSIS PUBIS (? VAGINAL) OF UNCERTAIN ETIOLOGY. CLINICAL CORRELATION IS RECOMMENDED.

NO BONE ABNORMALITIES ARE SEEN.
ILL-DEFINED ALVEOLAR OPACITIES IN THE LEFT LOWER LUNG ARE MOST LIKELY RELATED TO BRONCHOSCOPY AND POSSIBLY BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE. NO EVIDENCE OF PNEUMOTHORAX OR PLEURAL FLUID. PREVIOUSLY SEEN DILATED BRONCHI ARE NOT READILY EVIDENT.
