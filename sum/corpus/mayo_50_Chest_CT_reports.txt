CT scan of the heart was done to evaluate for coronary artery calcification. The examination is positive and shows definite calcium deposits which are diagnostic of atherosclerotic disease. The calcium score is 5. This score places this patient in the 42 percentile for quantity of calcification for her age and gender group when compared to our age and gender matched control group. There is calcification at the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Remainder is negative.

ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: Cirrhotic configuration of the liver with significant atrophy of the right hepatic lobe. A poorly defined 4.5cm low density area is seen in segment V of the right hepatic lobe (series 2, image 120; series 3, image 49; and series 4, image 40). This appearance is unchanged from prior exams and is worrisome for neoplasm versus inhomogeneous hepatic perfusion. Thrombus in the main portal vein (series 2, image 52) is smaller than on 2-13-07 and no longer extends into the SMV. However, there is new complete thrombosis of the left intrahepatic portal vein. A 1.2cm enhancing mass is seen immediately adjacent to the portal vein in the lower falciform ligament (series 3, image 32). This is also worrisome for a neoplasm and is new. Numerous collateral vessels in the upper abdomen form extensive esophageal varices, collateral vessels into the hepatic porta and splenorenal shunt. The fluid and edema in the mesentery has significantly decreased. Right pleural effusion has resolved. Adenopathy in the hepatic porta measuring up to 1.3cm in diameter (series 3, image 48).

The density measures only slightly higher than water density, but there is no enhancement after the administration of contrast material. This is most likely a bronchogenic cyst. Variations in size can sometimes occur with bronchogenic cysts. Endoscopic ultrasound may be helpful to confirm cystic nature.
