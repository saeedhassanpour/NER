37817795 FULL RESULT:  
Examination:  CT Chest, 09/08/2008. 

Clinical History:  Fibrous histiocytoma. Evaluate for metastases. 

Findings:  As noted, there are posttreatment changes in both lungs and pleural and parenchymal features with the most noted in the left lateral posterior chest wall. This area does have some pleural and reactive changes. Many sites have been present for some time; however, there is one focal area that is a little bit more prominent than the other. This is indeterminate at this time and suggest continued evaluation on routine fashion or if any clinical findings at this site, followup intervention with MRI may be helpful. However, these findings on the CT are indeterminate. No evidence of new parenchymal pulmonary nodules, and the intrathoracic opacities are similar to prior studies of 01/07/2008.  


IMPRESSION: 
1. Bilateral pleural and parenchymal posttreatment changes with the most noted feature being the posterior lateral aspect of the left chest wall with rib resection and soft tissue prominence as well as pleural reactive change. On image 54 series 2, this is more prominent chest wall soft tissues in the subpleural space compared to 01/07/2008; however, this has varied and was prominent on the prior study of 05/14/2007 as well, and suggest clinical correlation to see if there are any signs of symptoms of disease at this site. If so, MRI of the chest wall might be more helpful in demonstrating any reactive or new changes. However, at this time, these features are fairly consistent with posttreatment changes. No evidence of gross or new disease. 
2. There is changes in the left shoulder and left chest wall and upper arm consistent with underlying osteopenia most likely related to the prior intervention treatment with some dysfunction. CT         CT, LUNG, MEDIASTINUM PLEURA

Examination:  Chest CT with contrast, 06/05/2008 

Clinical History:  Breast cancer, follow up pulmonary nodules. 

Comparison:  12/17/2007. 

Findings:  Spiral CT of the chest was performed with 2.5-mm collimation using intravenous contrast. The cardiac chamber sizes are normal. Coronary artery calcifications are present. Tiny pericardial effusion. Adenopathy at the right hilum and ill-defined right and left paratracheal lymph nodes are unchanged. There are a number of scattered small pulmonary nodules in the 1-3-mm range of size in both lungs. There is a little lesser degree of inspiration with increased attenuation of lung bases with some minimal dependent atelectasis. No effusion. Low attenuation hepatic lesions are presumably simple cysts. Cholecystectomy clips and nephrectomy clips on the right. The remainder of the visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.  


IMPRESSION: 
Adenopathy and tiny pulmonary nodules remain unchanged and nonspecific over almost a year now. Active metastatic disease is unlikely. They may be followed up to document long term stability. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST

Examination:  CT Chest, 07/21/2008.  

Clinical History:  Sarcoidosis, followup.  

Findings:  CT chest 7/12/2007 and 02/19/2008.  

Numerous subcentimeter nodules, in parenchymal or subpleural locations, and spiculated masses, like a band of fibrosis, are noted in the lungs bilaterally.  The pre-existing disease has been relatively stable.  Additionally, there is a localized area of new ground-glass opacities in the right base (image #71 to 77).  This is associated with peribronchial thickening and nodules.  This could represent superimposed infectious process.  However, the progressing sarcoidosis is probably more likely.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  

Additionally, there are multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum predominantly at the prevascular chain, right paratracheal chain and subcarinal chains as well as in the hila bilaterally, grossly unchanged.  There is no evidence of new lymph node or lymphadenopathy.  

The visualized soft tissue is unremarkable.  


IMPRESSION:  
Development of localized area of ground-glass opacities in the right lower lobe and relatively stable disease in the rest of the lungs, mediastinum, and hila. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST

39021337 FULL RESULT:  
Examination:  CT scan of the chest, 08/07/2009.  

Clinical History:  Breast carcinoma.  

Findings:  

1.  Non intravenous contrast-enhanced scans have been obtained and there is a left pleural effusion with foci of loculation with some associated focal areas of pleural thickening in the region of the upper lobe of the left lung, a left chest tube is noted in place, findings can be clinically correlated for any malignant pleural effusion, this fluid was not noted on an outside hospital study obtained on 04/15/2005.

2.  There is no evidence of any confluent acute lung infiltrates.  Some linear subsegmental atelectatic foci are noted in the left lung.  There is no evidence of any lung nodules.  Some focal areas of pleural thickening in the right chest are identified and this may be related to chronic inflammatory changes.

3.  Some sclerotic foci are identified in some of the vertebral bodies and the ribs and in the sternum, findings compatible with metastatic foci (this cannot be compared to the outside hospital study of 04/15/2005 secondary to technical differences).  Additionally, there is compression with sclerosis superimposed on degenerative spondylosis in the seventh dorsal vertebral body and this may be related to metastasis superimposed on degenerative changes.

4.  There is a soft tissue attenuation focus in the midline of the lower chest in the anterior chest wall region abutting the sternal region with slight associated sternal sclerosis (series 2, images 32, 30), this measures approximately 2.4 x 1.6 cm in dimension and is compatible with recurrent focus.  This was not noted on the study of 2005, a focal opacity in the left lower anterior chest wall region (series 2, image 39) which may be related to postsurgical change is stable since the study of 2005.  Postsurgical changes are noted in the axillary and breast regions and some small axillary nodes possibly reactive in nature are identified.  There may be a tiny amount of air in the mediastinum (series 2, image 29).  


IMPRESSION:  
Left pleural effusion with loculation and this can be clinically correlated for malignant effusion, no lung nodules, soft tissue in the anterior chest wall region close to the midline as described, compatible with recurrence.  Some small nonspecific mediastinal nodes without significant lymphadenopathy, skeletal metastases as described.   Study has been obtained without intravenous contrast enhancement.

Examination:  CT of the chest with intravenous contrast, 05/14/2009. 

Clinical History:  Nasopharyngeal rhabdomyosarcoma.  

Comparison:   The study was correlated with the previous 12/11/2008.  

Findings:  Bilateral nonspecific pulmonary nodules remain in view of stability may be due to noncalcified granuloma though followup to exclude metastatic disease is recommended.  No new nodules are noted.  Lesions are noted in the left lung image 38, 43, 56, 58, in the lingula, peripherally image 73, and in the right lung nodules are noted posteriorly in the right lower lobe, image 58 and along the minor fissure, image 65, and image 67.  No sign of consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  There are no pleural effusions. 

Limited imaging of the abdomen shows no focal liver lesions.  A hypodensity in the spleen was present on the previous study is incompletely imaged on our study, most likely a cyst or hemangioma.  Followup can be performed.  The adrenal glands are unremarkable.  

There are bilateral central lines.  The right-sided central line terminates over the region of the SVC as does the left-sided central line.  

No mediastinal, hilar or axillary adenopathy. 


IMPRESSION:  
No definite sign of metastatic disease.  Stable nonspecific pulmonary nodules are unchanged from the interval from the previous study up to 3 mm in diameter.  Continued followup to exclude growth can be performed.  No new nodules are noted. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST

Examination:  Chest CT, 08/04/2009

Clinical History:  Colon cancer.

Technique:  A 2.5 mm spiral CT was performed from the lung apices to the bases utilizing intravenous contrast.

Findings:  No lung nodules suspicious for metastatic disease is definitely seen.
