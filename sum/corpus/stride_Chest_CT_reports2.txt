CT THORAX
CT THORAX:  01/22/2009   CLINICAL HISTORY:  Rule out metastatic disease.  COMPARISON:  10/28/2008.   TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric images were acquired from lung apices to  upper abdomen without intravenous administration of contrast.  Images  were reconstructed at 1 and 5 mm contiguous section thicknesses.    FINDINGS:  No supraclavicular, bilateral axillary, mediastinal, or  hilar lymphadenopathy.  Moderate coronary artery calcification is  again seen.  Aorta and main pulmonary artery diameters are within  normal limits.  No pericardial or pleural effusions.    Calcified granulomas are again noted in bilateral upper lobes.  No  new pulmonary nodules are identified.  No focal consolidation.   Central airways are patent without bronchiectasis.    Visualized upper abdominal organs are unremarkable.  Note again made  of sclerotic focus in lateral aspect of right fifth rib without  interval change.    IMPRESSION:   1.  NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC DISEASE.   2.  STABLE SCLEROTIC FOCUS INVOLVING RIGHT LATERAL FIFTH RIB.   SUMMARY:2-ABNORMAL, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED.

CT THORAX
EXAM: CT Thorax 6/29/2011 11:10 AM IMPRESSION: 1.FINDINGS COMPATIBLE WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS. CLINICAL HISTORY: ASSESSMENT OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS. COMPARISON: None 2.SMALL BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS AND PLEURAL THICKENING. TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were acquired through the thorax  without IV contrast at 1  mm and 5 mm slice thicknesses.  Sagittal,  SUMMARY:4-POSSIBLY SIGNIFICANT FINDING, MAY NEED ACTION coronal and maximum intensity projection reformations were performed. FINDINGS: A right anterior chest wall Mediport is present with distal  tip near the cava atrial junction.  Visualized portions of the  thyroid gland are unremarkable in appearance.  No pathologically  enlarged lymph nodes are present within the supraclavicular or  axillary lymph node stations.  Numerous mediastinal lymph nodes are  present in the bilateral paratracheal, AP window, and subcarinal  lymph node stations, measuring up to 14 mm in diameter.  The thoracic  aorta and main pulmonary artery are normal in caliber.  The heart is  normal in size.  There are no pericardial effusions. There is bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, mucous plugging,  and centrilobular nodularity involving all lobes of the lung.   Findings are worse within the lower lung zones, where there is volume  loss, particularly involving the right middle lobe and lingula.   There is significant air trapping seen in all lobes.  Bandlike  atelectasis or scar is seen within the left lower lobe adjacent to an  effusion.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions and pleural  thickening.  Tracheal diverticulum is seen arising from the right  posterolateral wall of the trachea at the thoracic inlet. Limited noncontrast evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates  lipomatous hypertrophy of the pancreas.  Multiple Schmorl&apos;s nodes are  seen within the thoracic spine.  No bony destructive lesions  identified.

CT THORAX
HIGH RESOLUTION CHEST CT: 09/20/2000 COMPARISON: None. CLINICAL DATA: 57-year-old man with a history of cardiomyopathy on amiodarone therapy. He is also on anticoagulation therapy for previous pulmonary embolism. PROCEDURE: Noncontrast 1 x 10 mm scans were obtained through the thorax. FINDINGS: The dual lead pacer is in place with one lead in the right atrium and the other at the floor of the right ventricle. The heart is markedly enlarged. Enlarged mediastinal nodes are seen in the subcarinal region, the paratracheal regions and in the paraesophageal region. Mild left hilar adenopathy is also present. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, left larger than right. Two 3 cm peripheral pleural-based nodular opacities are present, one at the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe and the other at the posterior aspect of the left lower lobe. The patient has mild bilateral centrilobular emphysema. There are some areas of mild interlobular septal thickening as well. The visualized portions of the organs in the upper abdomen are within normal limits given that no contrast was administered. IMPRESSION: 1. CARDIOMEGALY. 2. MEDIASTINAL AND LEFT HILAR ADENOPATHY, WHICH IS OF UNCERTAIN CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE. 3. MILD INTERSTITIAL PULMONARY EDEMA AND CENTRILOBULAR EMPHYSEMA. 4. TWO LARGE PERIPHERAL PLEURAL-BASED NODULAR OPACITIES IN THE LOWER LOBES, AS DETAILED ABOVE. THESE ARE AGE INDETERMINATE AND NONSPECIFIC. COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS CHEST RADIOGRAPHS, IF THEY CAN BE OBTSINED, WOULD BE OF SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT FOR FURTHER EVALUATION SINCE THESE MAY BE SECONDARY TO PULMONARY INFARCTION FROM PULMONARY EMBOLISM. INFECTIOUS OR NEOPLASTIC ETIOLOGIES CANNOT BE EXCLUDED EITHER. 5. THESE FINDINGS WERE DISCUSSED WITH DR. MATT BERENSON ON 09/21/2000. END OF IMPRESSION: SUMMARY: Possible Significant Abnormality/Change, may need action.
