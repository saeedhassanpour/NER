CT THORAX
CT SCAN OF THE THORAX, NOVEMBER 21, 2005: COMPARISON: Comparison is made with November 3, 2005. CLINICAL HISTORY: 69-year-old female status post total arch replacement with elephant trunk and re-implantation of the supra- aortic vessels. TECHNIQUE: Standard CT of the thorax was performed without intravenous contrast with 5 mm and 1.25 mm slice thickness. FINDINGS: This is a limited non-contrast evaluation. There are stable post- surgical changes after aortic repair with a ascending aortic and transverse aortic graft. The graft extends into the brachicephalic artery and the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries have been re-implanted. Stable appearance in position of an endograft within the distal transverse thoracic aorta extending into the proximal descending thoracic aorta without evidence of graft discontinuity. There are evolving post-surgical changes within the mediastinum with decreased amount of mediastinal hematoma. There is low density fluid positioned along the medial aspect of the aortic arch and within the AP window which deviates the trachea and esophagus to the right consisting with known evolving mediastinal hematoma. The previously noted pericardial effusion has decreased in size and there is now only a small residual pericardial effusion. Persistent moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions. There is limited evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma secondary to patient motion but there is atelectasis noted in the left upper lobe, left lower lobe, and right lower lobe. There are more ill- defined patchy areas of parenchymal opacity which have developed since the prior scan within the periphery of the right upper lobe, middle lobe and anterior right lower lobe which are non-specific. Right internal jugular venous catheter with the tip in the distal superior vena cava. Limited non-contrast evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates abdominal ascites and diffuse infiltration of the abdominal wall subcutaneous tissue and musculature consistent with diffuse anasarca. Evaluation of the bony structures demonstrates post-surgical changes status post median sternotomy IMPRESSION: 1. LIMITED NON-CONTRAST CT OF THE THORAX DEMONSTRATES GROSSLY STABLE POST-OPERATIVE APPEARANCE AFTER ASCENDING AND TRANSVERSE AORTIC GRAFT WITH RE-IMPLANTATION OF THE SUPRA-AORTIC VESSELS. STABLE APPEARANCE AND POSITION OF AN ENDOGRAFT IN THE DISTAL TRANSVERSE AORTIC ARCH EXTENDING INTO THE PROXIMAL DESCENDING THORACIC AORTA. 2.EVOLVING POST-OPERATIVE MEDIASTINAL HEMATOMA AND INTERVAL DECREASE IN SIZE OF PERICARDIAL EFFUSION. 2. PERSISTENT BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS AND ATELECTASIS. 3. INTERVAL DEVELOPMENT OF PATCHY AREAS OF PARENCHYMAL OPACITY WITHIN THE RIGHT UPPER LOBE, RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE, AND RIGHT LOWER LOBE WHICH MAY REPRESENT A FOCUS OF INFECTION, ASPIRATION OR POSSIBLY RESOLVING ASYMMETRIC PULMONARY EDEMA. CORRELATION IS RECOMMENDED.

CT OF THE CHEST: 05/22/2002. COMPARISON: Outside CT&apos;s from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, dated 04/03/2002 and 02/12/2002, labelled with the patient&apos;s name. Additional comparison is made to a CT of the chest from this institution, dated 01/07/2002. TECHNIQUE: Spiral CT acquisition through the chest, without intravenous contrast at 2 mm slice thickness. FINDINGS: The comparisons to the examinations from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania are of limited value, as no lung windows are included. I am able to compare from the lung windows from the study at this institution from 01/07/2002. There as been marked interval improvement in the bilateral pulmonary nodules since the 01/07/2002 examination. The only nodule remaining is a 3 mm nodule in the right upper lobe on image no. 60 of series 3, which is stable since 01/07/2002. No pleural or pericardial effusions. No enlarged axillary, hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes are identified. The visualized upper abdominal viscera have a unremarkable non-contrast appearance. Review of skeletal structures does not reveal any suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. IMPRESSION: 1. MARKED INTERVAL DECREASE IN BILATERAL PULMONARY NODULES. ONLY A 3 MM RIGHT UPPER LOBE NODULE REMAINS SINCE 01/07/2002, AND THIS NODULE IS STABLE SINCE THAT TIME. 2. NO EVIDENCE OF ENLARGED LYMPH NODES IN THE CHEST. END OF IMPRESSION: SUMMARY: 2

CT THORAX
DIAGNOSIS: V10.11 CHEST CT:  06/26/98 CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old female with history of carcinoma of the right lung, status post chemotherapy and radiation.  Follow- up examination. TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images performed at 8.0 mm intervals through the thorax following administration of intravenous contrast. COMPARISON:  01/16/98. FINDINGS:  Evaluation of the mediastinum shows interval progressive soft tissue abnormality in the right paratracheal region immediately superior to the origin of the right mainstem bronchus, with soft tissue abnormality also continuing posteriorly along the right mainstem bronchus into the azygoesophageal recess.  This area previously was free from soft tissue abnormality.  Findings are concerning for local disease progression.  Adjacent lung parenchymal changes consisting of linear and reticular opacities predominantly along the right mediastinum are consistent with postradiation changes. No separate or discrete pulmonary nodules are identified. Review of upper abdominal viscera shows no suspicious lesions within the liver, with several areas of heterogeneity in a somewhat geographical distribution, likely perfusion artifact.  The adrenal glands are normal. IMPRESSION: 1.  FINDINGS CONCERNING FOR LOCAL PROGRESSION OF DISEASE, WITH INCREASED SOFT TISSUE ABNORMALITY IN THE RIGHT PERITRACHEAL AND PERIHILAR REGION. 2.  POSTRADIATION CHANGES IN THE ADJACENT LUNG PARENCHYMA. END OF IMPRESSION: SUMMARY: Possible Significant Abnormality/Change, may need action. I have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agree with the report transcribed above. By: Ann Leung  on: 06/27/1998  08:05

CT THORAX W CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: EXAM: CT Thorax with contrast 10/8/2012 8:54 AM CLINICAL HISTORY: 45-year-old woman with fatigue, dizziness,  1. NO EVIDENCE OF THYMOMA hypotension and positive striated muscle antibody, referred for  consideration of thymoma. 2. NONSPECIFIC LINEAR CLUSTER OF 2-MM NODULES IN THE LATERAL BASAL  RIGHT LOWER LOBE, WHICH MAY REPRESENT SEQUELA OF PRIOR INFECTION. IF  THE PATIENT IS NOT AT ELEVATED RISK FOR LUNG CANCER, SUCH AS HISTORY  COMPARISON: None OF SMOKING, NO FURTHER CT FOLLOW-UP IMAGING IS NECESSARY.  TECHNIQUE: Volumetric acquisition was obtained from the lung apex  through the upper abdomen following intravenous administration of  SUMMARY:4-POSSIBLY SIGNIFICANT FINDING, MAY NEED ACTION contrast (88-ML of Omnipaque 350). Data were reconstructed at  contiguous 1 mm and 5 mm section thicknesses. Sagittal, coronal and  maximum intensity projection reformations were performed. Based on a 32 cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol  [mGy]) for each series in this exam is: 4.27. The estimated  cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 153.  NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the &apos;volume CT Dose  Index&apos; (CTDIvol) given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length  Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from  the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical  study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may  therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual&apos;s  absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors. FINDINGS:  The visualized portions of the thyroid gland are unremarkable. No  mediastinal mass that indicates presence of thymoma. Five pulmonary nodules measuring up to 2 mm in a linear distribution  are present in the lateral basal right lower lobe (series 3, images  185 through 188). A pleural-based opacity measuring 3 mm in the  posterior right upper lobe likely represents small amount of  atelectasis. No pleural effusions. The airways are patent and of  normal course and caliber. The heart size is normal without pericardial effusion. The aorta is  normal in course and caliber. Coronary artery calcifications are not  present. The main pulmonary artery is normal in course and caliber. While not  a dedicated pulmonary embolism study, no filling defects are seen in  the main or lobar pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism. No mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.  Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen in arterial phase is  unremarkable. No suspicious bony lesions identified.

NONCONTRAST CHEST CT:  04/06/2009   TECHNIQUE:  Following acquisition of two scout images, a noncontrast  helical CT of the chest was performed with reconstruction into 0.625  mm slices.  Axial reformations were obtained in 1.25 and 5 mm slices.   Images were also reformatted into coronal and sagittal planes.  Axial  MIP images were provided.    CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 76-year-old female, no history provided.   COMPARISON:  None.   FINDINGS:  The main pulmonary artery measures 3 cm in diameter which  is nonspecific but may be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial  hypertension.  Mild coronary calcifications and mild atherosclerotic  calcifications of the aorta and its branches are demonstrated.  The  pericardium is within normal limits.  Subcentimeter mediastinal nodes  are present.  There is no obvious hilar adenopathy, although  evaluation is limited without intravenous contrast.  There may be a  small calcified left hilar node.  A focal filling defect in the  trachea is nonspecific but could represent minor airway secretions.   No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.    There are scattered areas of mild bronchiectasis.  Scattered areas  of linear atelectasis/scarring are noted at the lung bases.  Some  mucus plugging is noted.   Multiple hepatic cysts are demonstrated, the largest in the right  hepatic lobe measuring 2.8 x 3.4 cm.  Additional subcentimeter  hypodensities in the liver are too small to characterize.  The  gallbladder has been surgically removed.  There is prominence of the  intra and extrahepatic biliary system.  The common bile duct is  partially imaged and measures up to 1.2 cm.  The osseous structures  demonstrate mild degenerative changes.    IMPRESSION:   1.  SCATTERED AREAS OF MILD BRONCHIECTASIS.    2.  FOCAL FILLING DEFECT IN THE TRACHEA WHICH IS NONSPECIFIC BUT MAY  REPRESENT SECRETIONS.  CLINICAL CORRELATION AND COMPARISON WITH ANY  AVAILABLE PRIOR EXAMS IS SUGGESTED.   3.  PROMINENCE OF THE INTRA AND EXTRAHEPATIC BILIARY SYSTEM WITH THE  PARTIALLY IMAGED COMMON BILE DUCT MEASURING UP TO 1.2 CM IN DIAMETER.   AGAIN, CLINICAL CORRELATION AND COMPARISON WITH AVAILABLE PRIOR EXAMS  ARE SUGGESTED.  OTHERWISE, AN ULTRASOUND MAY BE OBTAINED FOR FURTHER  EVALUATION IF INDICATED.    SUMMARY:4-POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS, MAY NEED ACTION.   I have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agreed with the report transcribed above.
