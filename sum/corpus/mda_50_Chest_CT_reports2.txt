38425343 FULL RESULT:  
Examination:  CT of the chest, 03/02/2009.  

Clinical History:  Metastatic acinic cell of right cheek.  Evaluation of disease.  

Findings:  CT of the chest was performed with intravenous contrast at 5 mm collimation.  The comparison study is 01/05/2009.  There is no evidence of axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  There are no pleural effusions.  There is coronary artery calcification.

There is lytic destructive change of the right scapula with soft tissue mass and is grossly stable.  Lytic metastases are noted in the spine and these are grossly stable.

There are bilateral lung nodules consistent with metastases.  Most of these are stable.  One of the largest lesions is in the right lower lobe measuring approximately 1.8 cm.  There is a nodule in the right upper lobe that is somewhat obscured by motion artifact.  Previously this measured approximately 1.4 cm and currently measures approximately 1.1 cm.  This may be an inaccurate due to the motion artifact.  A few lesions are possibly marginally increased.  One such is in the left lower lobe previously measuring approximately 1 cm and currently measuring approximately 1.1 cm.  This could be slight differences in measurement error or marginal increase in the size of the lesion.  Please see separate CT abdomen and pelvis report of same day.  


IMPRESSION:  
1.  Most of the pulmonary metastases appear stable.  One is slightly decreased.  A few may be marginally increased.  
2.  Bone metastases are stable. CT         CT, LUNG, MED, PLEURA W/CONTRAST

Comparison:  07/07/2007.  

Clinical History:  Breast cancer.  Wound.  

Findings:  
1.  Radiation changes to the anterior left upper lung, left chest wall, left anterior ribs, left clavicle, and half of the sternum remain stable.  There are dystrophic calcifications within the soft tissues.  The previous skin ulceration has resolved.  There are no pulmonary nodules.  There is no effusion.  There is no pericardial effusion.  There is no supraclavicular, mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.

2.  Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate normal-appearing adrenal glands and a stable tiny low attenuation lesion in the liver on image 81 too small to characterize and thought to be benign.  


IMPRESSION:  
1.  Radiation changes in the left chest wall are stable with interval resolution of the ulcer.

Examination:  Chest CT with contrast, 06/23/2009.  

Clinical History:  Restrictive lung disease and pulmonary nodules.

Comparison: 09/13/2007.  

Findings:  Spiral CT of the chest is performed with 2.5 mm collimation using intravenous contrast.  Bilateral breast implants.  Paramediastinal radiation changes are present.  Cardiac structures are normal.  No mediastinal adenopathy.  There are some small foci of scarring in the lungs and pleural nodularity that probably represents scarring.  In addition, there are some tiny pulmonary nodules such as image 44 on the right and 39 and 79 on the left.  There is also a small focus of pleural thickening on the left on image 61.  All of these are stable over more than 2 years and may be presumed benign.  No new or growing nodules.  No effusion.  Heterogeneous appearance of the liver is related to phase of contrast enhancement.  There is a hepatic cyst demonstrated.  The right kidney is absent.  The remainder of the visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.  There is thoracolumbar scoliosis with a spine stabilization rod in place.
