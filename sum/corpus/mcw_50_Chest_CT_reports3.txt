THORACIC AND ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSMS
CT ANGIO CHEST, CT ANGIO ABD & CT ANGIO PELVIS (#129A-B-C) COMPARISON: CT ANGIO CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS DATED [date]. TECHNIQUE: HELICAL ACQUISITION WAS USED TO OBTAIN 0.625 THIN SLICE DATA SET FOR RECONSTRUCTION FOLLOWING THE ADMINISTRATION OF 93 ML OF VISIPAQUE 320. 2.5 MM AXIAL RECONSTRUCTIONS WERE PERFORMED THROUGH THE CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS. THERE ARE ALSO 3-D RECONSTRUCTIONS AND MULTIPLANAR VASCULAR ANALYSIS PROVIDED. FINDINGS: IN THE BASE OF THE NECK, THERE IS STABLE RIGHT HEMITHYROID DENSITY AND ENLARGEMENT. THIS IS NODULAR IN APPEARANCE AND APPEARS TO EXTEND INTO THE ISTHMUS. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT LYMPHADENOPATHY. IN THE THORAX, THERE IS CENTILOBULAR EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGES BILATERALLY, AND STABLE SCATTERED AREAS OF GROUND-GLASS ATELECTASIS. MITRAL ANNULAR CALCIFICATIONS ARE NOTED. TORTUOUS AND STABLE THORACIC AORTIC ANEURYSM. THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN CALIBER. PROXIMAL DESCENDING THORACIC AORTA IS STABLE AT 3.9 CM. DISTAL DESCENDING THORACIC AORTA IS STABLE AT 5.2 CM. SUPRARENAL AORTA IS STABLE AT 3.9 CM. INFRARENAL AORTA IS STABLE AT 4.4 CM. THE CELIAC, SUPERIOR MESENTERIC, AND RENAL ARTERIES ARE PATENT. THE INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY IS PATENT VIA A RECANALIZATION THROUGH THE ANEURYSM SAC ANTERIORLY. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CALCIFICATION AND THROMBUS THROUGHOUT THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM; THIS ALSO INCLUDES THE BILATERAL COMMON ILIACS AND FEMORAL ARTERIES, WHICH ARE PATENT AND EXHIBIT A MODERATE AMOUNT OF INTRALUMINAL CONTRAST. AGAIN NOTED IS THE IRREGULAR MURAL RENAL PELVIS THICKENING OF THE LEFT KIDNEY. THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A CHOLECYSTECTOMY. THE LIVER, SPLEEN, BILATERAL ADRENALS, PANCREAS, AND KIDNEYS ARE OTHERWISE UNREMARKABLE. IN THE PELVIS, THE UTERUS IS ATROPHIC. THE PATIENT EXHIBITS A LARGE DISTENDED BLADDER, BUT WITHOUT ANY ABNORMAL PELVIC LYMPHADENOPATHY OR FLUID COLLECTIONS. IN THE SKELETON, DEGENERATIVE CHANGES AND OSTEOPOROSIS ARE NOTED THROUGHOUT, BUT UNREMARKABLE GIVEN THE PATIENT'S AGE.
1. STABLE THORACIC AND ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSMS. ITS TORTUOUS PATH, CALCIFICATIONS, AND SIGNIFICANT ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUING ARE ALSO STABLE. 2. IRREGULAR RENAL PELVIS THICKENING OF THE LEFT COLLECTING SYSTEM IS STABLE SINCE THE PREVIOUS EXAM AND IS OF UNCERTAIN CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE. 3. STABLE NODULAR RIGHT HEMITHYROID DENSITY EXTENDING INTO THE ISTHMUS, MOST LIKELY REPRESENTS MULTINODULAR GOITER. 4. DEGENERATIVE CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE AXIAL SKELETON. 5. OSTEOPOROSIS. 6. MITRAL ANNULUS CALCIFICATIONS. 7. POST CHOLECYSTECTOMY. + EXAMINATION REVIEWED & REPORTED FINDINGS CONFIRMED BY: [doctor].

R/O PE
CT THORAX AND CT PELVIS (#244 B&C) TECHNIQUE: CONTIGUOUS 1.25 MM HELICAL SCANS THROUGH THE CHEST WERE PERFORMED AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION OF 123 CC OMNIPAQUE 350. IN ADDITION, 5 MM AXIAL SCANS THROUGH THE PELVIS AND LOWER EXTREMITIES WERE PERFORMED TO EVALUATE FOR DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS. COMPARISON: COMPARISON IS MADE TO PRIOR CT SCAN [date]. FINDINGS: PROMINENT CYSTIC CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE LUNGS, PARTICULARLY IN THE LUNG APICES. THIS HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRIOR CT FROM 2002. GROUND-GLASS OPACITY IS IDENTIFIED IN THE LUNG BASES. THERE IS A FOCAL AREA OF CONSOLIDATION IN THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE RIGHT UPPER LOBE. THIS IS WORRISOME FOR A PNEUMONIA. IN ADDITION, IN SEVERAL OF THE CYSTIC AREAS IN THE POSTERIOR-SUPERIOR ASPECT OF THE RIGHT UPPER LOBE, THERE ARE SOFT TISSUE NODULES FILLING SEVERAL OF THESE CAVITARY CYSTIC AREAS. NO PULMONARY EMBOLISM OR DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS IS IDENTIFIED. THE HEART SIZE IS NORMAL. THERE IS NO PERICARDIAL OR PLEURAL EFFUSION. MEDIASTINAL ADENOPATHY IS IDENTIFIED IN A PRETRACHEAL, RIGHT PARATRACHEAL AND SUBCARINAL AREAS. SEVERAL OF THESE LYMPH NODES ARE CALCIFIED. THERE ARE ALSO CALCIFIED LEFT HILAR LYMPH NODES. LIMITED EVALUATION OF THE UPPER ABDOMEN IS UNREMARKABLE.
1. DIFFUSE ABNORMAL LUNG DISEASE WHICH IS PRESUMED TO BE RELATED TO SARCOIDOSIS. THERE IS SEVERE CYSTIC CHANGE PARTICULARLY IN THE LUNG APICES. THIS HAS PROGRESSED SUBSTANTIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO EXAMINATION OF 2002. 2. FOCAL AREA OF CONSOLIDATION IS IDENTIFIED IN THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE RIGHT UPPER LOBE. THIS IS WORRISOME FOR A PNEUMONIA. 3. WITHIN THE POSTERIOR-SUPERIOR ASPECT OF THE RIGHT UPPER LOBE, SOFT TISSUE DENSITIES ARE IDENTIFIED FILLING SEVERAL OF THESE CYSTIC AREAS. THIS COULD REPRESENT INFECTION BY ASPERGILLOSIS AND SUBSEQUENT ASPERGILLOMA. NONINFECTED DEBRIS IS ANOTHER CONSIDERATION. 4. NO PE OR DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS IS IDENTIFIED. + EXAMINATION REVIEWED & REPORTED FINDINGS CONFIRMED BY: [doctor]

ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
CT CHEST AND CT ABDOMEN, [date]; (#96A,B): COMPARISON: [date]. TECHNIQUE: HELICAL ACQUISITION WAS PERFORMED AFTER THE ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF CONTRAST MATERIAL AND THE INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF 145 CC OF OMNIPAQUE-300 AND CONTIGUOUS 2.5 MM AXIAL IMAGES ARE REVIEWED. FINDINGS: THERE IS A NEW EXPANSILE LESION OF THE LEFT SECOND RIB ANTERIORLY WHICH MEASURES 3 CM IN DIAMETER AND APPROXIMATELY 5.5 CM IN LENGTH AND IS BEST SEEN ON IMAGE #30. THERE HAVE BEEN SLIGHT CHANGES IN MULTIPLE VERTEBRAL BODY METASTASES INCLUDING T5, T6, T9, T11, T12, L1, AND L2 AND L4. IN ADDITION, THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESSION OF METASTATIC LESION IN THE RIGHT ILIAC CREST BEST SEEN ON IMAGE #183 THROUGH #190. THE LUNGS REMAIN CLEAR. THERE IS NO PLEURAL OR PERICARDIAL EFFUSION. THERE IS NO HILAR OR MEDIASTINAL ADENOPATHY. VISUALIZED STRUCTURES AT THE BASE OF THE NECK ARE UNREMARKABLE AND THERE IS NO AXILLARY ADENOPATHY. MULTIPLE LOW ATTENUATION LESIONS ARE SEEN IN THE LIVER AND FOR THE MOST PART, THESE APPEAR SMALLER. NO NEW LIVER LESIONS ARE SEEN. THE SPLEEN, PANCREAS, AND ADRENALS ARE NORMAL. A 1 CM NODULE IS AGAIN SEEN IN THE LEFT ADRENAL AND IS UNCHANGED. A CALCULUS IS SEEN IN THE LEFT KIDNEY WHICH IS UNCHANGED. THE KIDNEYS ARE OTHERWISE UNREMARKABLE. THE BOWEL LOOPS ARE NORMAL IN CALIBER. NO MESENTERIC STRANDING OR FREE FLUID IS SEEN. THERE IS NO ABDOMINAL ADENOPATHY PRESENT.
1. PROGRESSION OF BONE METASTASIS WITH THE MOST STRIKING PROGRESSION INVOLVING THE LEFT ANTERIOR SECOND RIB WITH A LARGE MASS NOW PRESENT WHERE SOME MINIMAL IRREGULARITY IN CONTOUR AND DENSITY WAS SEEN PREVIOUSLY. THE SECOND MOST PROGRESSION INVOLVES THE RIGHT ILIAC CREST. 2. SLIGHT DECREASE IN SIZE OF MOST OF THE HEPATIC LOW ATTENUATION LESIONS. 3. STABLE LEFT ADRENAL NODULE AND LEFT RENAL CALCULUS.
